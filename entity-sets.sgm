<h2 id=entity-sets>Character Entity Sets

<p>The following entity names are used in HTML, always prefixed by
ampersand (&) and followed by a semicolon@@ as shown. They represent
particular graphic characters which have special meanings in places in
the markup, or may not be part of the character set available to the
writer.

<h3>Numeric and Special Graphic Entity Set

<p>The following table lists each of the supported characters
specified in the Numeric and Special Graphic entity set, along with
its name, syntax for use, and description. This list is derived from
ISO Standard 8879:1986//ENTITIES Numeric and Special Graphic//EN.
However, HTML does not provide support for the entire entity set -
