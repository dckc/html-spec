<h2 id=entity-sets>Character Entity Sets

<p>The HTML DTD defines the following entities.  They represent
particular graphic characters which have special meanings in places in
the markup, or may not be part of the character set available to the
writer.

<h3>Numeric and Special Graphic Entity Set

<p>The following table lists each of the characters included from the
Numeric and Special Graphic entity set, along with its name, syntax
for use, and description. This list is derived from <code>ISO Standard
8879:1986//ENTITIES Numeric and Special Graphic//EN</code>.  However,
HTML does not include for the entire entity set -- only the entities
listed below are included.
