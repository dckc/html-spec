<H1>Fill-out Forms and Input fields</H1>

<P>Forms are composed by placing input fields within paragraphs,
preformatted/literal text, lists and tables.
This gives considerable scope in designing the layout of forms.

<H2>Elements</H2>

<P>The form features use the following elements which are all
known as HTML level 2 elements.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z12" REL="SUBDOCUMENT"
HREF="Elements/FORM.html">FORM</A>

<DD>a form within a document.

<DT><A NAME="z13" REL="SUBDOCUMENT"
HREF="Elements/INPUT.html">INPUT</A>

<DD>one input field of one of a variety of typed

<DT><A NAME="z14" REL="SUBDOCUMENT"
HREF="Elements/TEXTAREA.html">TEXTAREA</A>

<DD>a multline input field

<DT><A NAME="z15" REL="SUBDOCUMENT"
HREF="Elements/SELECT.html">SELECT</A>

<DD>A selection from a finite set of options

<DT><A NAME="z16" REL="SUBDOCUMENT"
HREF="Elements/OPTION.html">OPTION</A>

<DD>one option within a SELECT

<DT>Proposed Elements

<DT><A NAME="z17" REL="SUBDOCUMENT"
HREF="Elements/HTEXTAREA.html">HTEXTAREA</A>

<DD>an input field for hypertext.

<DD>
</DL>

<H2></H2>

<P>Each variable field is defined by an <A
NAME="z3" HREF="Elements/INPUT.html">INPUT</A> ,
TEXTAREA, or OPTION element and must have an NAME attribute which
uniquely names the field in the document.
Additional optional attributes can be used to specify the type
of the field (defaults to free text), its size/precision,
its initial value and whether the field is currently disabled
or in error:

<P>This fictitious example is a questionnaire that will be emailed
to www_admin@info.cern.ch .

<P>Servers can disable forms by sending an appropriate header
or by an attribute on the optional HTMLPLUS element at the very
start of the document, e.g. &#60;htmlplus forms=off&#62; .

<P>Here, the &#60;P&#62; and &#60;UL&#62; elements have been
used to lay out the text (and input fields.
The browser has changed the background color within the <A
NAME="z11" HREF="Elements/FORM.html">FORM</A> element to distinguish
the form from other parts of the document.
The browser is responsible for handling the input focus,
i.e. which field will currently get keyboard input.

<P>For many platforms there will be existing conventions for
forms, e.g. "tab" and "shift-tab" keys to move the keyboard focus
forwards and backwards between fields, while an "Enter" key submits
the form. In the example, the "submit" and "reset" buttons are
specified explicitly with special purpose fields.
The "submit" button is used to email the form or send its contents
to the server as specified by the ACTION attribute,
while the "reset" button resets the fields to their initial values.
When the form consists of a single text field,
it may be appropriate to leave such buttons out and rely on the
"Enter" key.

<P>The <A NAME="z2" HREF="Elements/INPUT.html">INPUT</A> element
is used for a large variety of typed of input fields.

<P>When you need to let users enter more than one line of text,
you should use the <A NAME="z4"
HREF="Elements/TEXTAREA.html">TEXTAREA</A> element.

<H2>Representing choices</H2>

<P>The <A NAME="z5"
HREF="Elements/INPUT.html#z2">RADIO</A> and <A
NAME="z6" HREF="Elements/INPUT.html#z3">CHECKBOX</A> types of<A
NAME="z8" HREF="Elements/INPUT.html"> INPUT</A> field can be
used to specify multiple choice forms in which every alternative
is visible as part of the form. An alternative is to use the
<A NAME="z7" HREF="Elements/SELECT.html">SELECT</A> element which
is generally rendered in a more compact fashion as a pull down
combo list.
