<h1>August 22, 1994 Release Notes</h1>

<p> At the July, 1994 Toronto IETF meeting, I presented a draft of the
HTML 2.0 specification in hopes that it would be considered for
submission as an internet RFC. The working group decided that the
document was not ready for publication -- that it needed significant
editorial, as well as minor technical, polishing.

<p> In spite of the fact that my resources for this project had been
exhausted, I agreed to coordinate the revisions. This was a
mistake. My resources for this project have <em>really</em> been
exhausted.

<p> I am releasing the HTML 2.0 materials, such as they are:

<ul>

<li> <a href="html-19940822-ps.gz">The postscript document,
     gzipped</a>. We're not quite sure this exactly matches the Frame
     version or the HTML version. The process of producing the PS and
     HTML is somewhat buggy and tedious.

<li> <a href="html-19940822-html.tar.gz">A gzip'd tar file of the
     document in HTML format</a>. Ironically, the HTML used here is
     not conforming to the document itself. It's generated by some
     tools that I didn't write. This is the same as <a
     href="http://www.hal.com/products/sw/olias/Build-html/CGQL0ZBEfmg24aK.html">
     the tree on the HaL HTTP server</a>.

<li> <a href="html-19940822-frame.tar.gz">The document as a FrameMaker
     book</a>. This is an intermediate product between an SGML editing
     system and the postscript output. It may, however, be the mose
     useful format for many purposes.

<li> <a href="html-19940822-sgml.tar.gz">The SGML representable portions
     of the specification</a>; that is, the DTD. This part is well tested.

</ul>

<h2>What's Left To Do?</h2>

<p> My notes on all this are very much scattered, but here's what comes
    to mind:

<ul>

<li> Rearrange the info/about/TOC/status sections

<li> Fix up the character set discussions

<li> Fix up the forms sections

<li> Remove references to NCSA image tutorials

<li> Add a section on HTML and HTTP interactions (inline images, forms, etc.)

<li> Fix the ISOlat1 declaration in the DTD

<li> Revise the terms/references section

</ul>
