<p> HTML+ is a set of features and a DTD, originally proposed by Dave
    Ragget <tt>&lt;dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com&gt;</tt> some time ago in
    response to feature requests from a wide variety of information
    producers and consumers with whom he consulted.

<p> Parts of the proposal have been implemented in various WWW user
    agents: the FORM support in Mosaic and friends originates from
    HTML+. I believe Pei Wei's Viola implements much of HTML+
    (somebody want to surf up a URL for Viola for me?). The
    emacs-based w3 browser by Bill Perry also implements much of the
    proposal.

<p> Dave Ragget is now collaborating with some of the CERN folks on a
    browser called Arena that supports tables, math, and other HTML+
    features.

<p> Unfortunately, Dave Raggett doesn't seem to have a handy welcome
    page that always points to the most up-to-date copy of the HTML+
    proposal -- he seems to beg, borrow, and steal space on HTTP/FTP
    servers now and again.

<p> I recently asked Dave what the current status of all this is, and
    here's his response:

Subject: Re: Current HTML 3.x DTD?

Dan,

&gt; Now then... I get a lot of inquiries about HTML+ and HTML 3.0.  I'd
&gt; also like to make the HTML+ DTD available as an option in my
&gt; validation service. But I don't know where to go for the "current"
&gt; HTML+ spec. Dave: do you maintain a web space? Is there a URL
&gt; that will always point to the latest HTML+ spec?

I have frozen the HTML+ DTD some time ago. You can get a copy from:

        ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/htmlplus.dtd.txt

As for HTML 3.0, Hakon and I are preparing some online info and I will
include a draft DTD, based on the HTML 2.0 and HTML+ DTDs. If you like
I could include a pointer to the old work on HTML+ and its DTD.
