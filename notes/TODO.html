<ul>

<li>Change the organization of the printed doc so that the "HTML
Elements" section isn't so monolithic. The TOC should look like:

<ol>
  <li> About this doc
  <li> Vocabulary
  <li> HTML and MIME
  <li> HTML and SGML
  <li> Text, Structured text, and special characters
  <li> HEAD/BODY
  <li> Hypertext Links
  <li> Paragraphs, linebreaks
  <li> Headings and Titles
  <li> Lists
  <li> Emphasis and Phrases
  <li> Preformatted Text
  <li> Address, Blockquote, etc.
  <li> Images
  <li> Forms
</ol>

<li>Send Announcement to:
	www-talk@info.cern.ch
	www-announce@info.cern.ch

<li>Copyright info?

<li>Add a Rationale section; move historical notes there

<li>Element Reference: include Parent elements

<li>Element Reference: build one for just Level0 features, for Level 1 features...

<li>Printed version: integrate the DTD better

<li>Printed version: fit more info on a page, as per LaTeX article
format (this format is fine for two-sided, bound books, but not so
good for ghostview style stuff).

<li>Printed version: enough info to point to online version
	at a section granularity.

<li>Printed version: RCS ID or some very precise date.

<li>Collect all HTML-related mail into an online archive (WAIS? hypermail?)
