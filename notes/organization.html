<p>The document is becoming something of a hodgepodge
of information related to various elements and such.

<p>On the one hand, it's nice to be able to visit the "P.html"
node and learn everything there is to know about the P element,
but it's not clear that this organizational model works well
for elements like B, I, CITE, etc. It becomes unwieldy to
repeat all these issues in all these nodes.

<p>In my experience, there are two very distinct technical
writing techniques: successive elaboration and exhaustive enumeration.

<p>In successive elaboration, you tell the whole story
in a short bit of text. Then you tell the story in a
little more detail, then a little more, until you've
covered just about everything. It's the easiest organizational
model for readers to learn from.

<p>In exhaustive enumeration, you iterate through all the
combinations and permutations in a systematic way. Such
a text serves well as a reference, but poorly as an
introduction.

<p>I am trying to reorganize the document into separate
parts: a successive elaboration of the concepts, techniques
and mechanisms, and then a machine-generated exhaustive
enumeration appendix (see the Element Reference section.)

<p>Comments on gross document orgainzation are solicited.
