<dt><a href="../index.html">Feb 1995: HTML 2.0 Spec Review</a>

<dd> This is an effort to create a specification for interoperablility
among implementations of HTML. The plan is that it will be published
as an Internet RFC, under the HTML Working Group.

<dt> HTML 2.0 July 1994 draft: Berners-Lee, Connolly, Muldrow

<dd> The HTML specification was rewritten for consistency and
usability by <a href="http://www.hal.com/~karen">Karen Muldrow</a> at
HaL over the summer of 1994. Dan Connolly presented the draft at the
Toronto IETF meeting, where the HTML working group was formed.

<DT> <A HREF="../../html-test/README.html">1994 April: HTML test
suite; Dan Connolly</a> <DD>The internet draft spec for HTML expired,
and there has been a lot of noise about a new spec. I've collected a
test suite of HTML documents and created a DTD to parse them (with a
few minor tweaks.)

<p> Included are <a HREF="../../html-test/html.dtd">DTD for HTML</a>
that reflects current practice, along with a <a
HREF="../../html-test/">whole mess of HTML files I got from various
places to test it out</a>. This stuff has not been prepared for
distribution, but you can check out the <a
HREF="../../html-test/Makefile">Makefile</a> for clues.

now supported by Bill Perry's w3 mode for emacs and by tkWWW. <A

  <CITE>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): A Representation of Textual 
  Information and MetaInformation for Retrieval and

<DD>This internet draft (now expired) was "sponsored" by the
<em>Integration of Internet Information Resources</em> (IIIR) working
group of the <em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em> (IETF).<p>

It was submitted as a specification for a MIME content type called
<CODE>text/html</CODE>.

HyperText Mark-up Language; by Tim Berners-Lee
</A>

<DD>Tim Berners-Lee originally drafted this as a somewhat informal
reference on the HTML elements. The document has been edited
continuously since then, with snapshots published through various means.

<H2> <a name="history">HTML 1.0: Historical</a></H2>

<p> This is the level mandatory for all WWW clients.
Level-1 is basically the HTML of the initial WWW clients, plus images.
The level 1 spec is relatively old, so a better specification is to take
the level 1 features from level 2, above.
About level-1 there is:
