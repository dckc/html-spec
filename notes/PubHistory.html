<dt><a href="../index.html">Feb 1995: HTML 2.0 Spec Review</a>

<dd> This is an effort to create a specification for interoperablility
among implementations of HTML. The plan is that it will be published
as an Internet RFC, under the HTML Working Group.

<dt> HTML 2.0 July 1994 draft: Berners-Lee, Connolly, Muldrow

<dd> The HTML specification was rewritten for consistency and
usability by <a href="http://www.hal.com/~karen">Karen Muldrow</a> at
HaL over the summer of 1994. Dan Connolly presented the draft at the
Toronto IETF meeting, where the HTML working group was formed.

<DT> <A HREF="../../html-test/README.html">1994 April: HTML test
suite; Dan Connolly</a> <DD>The internet draft spec for HTML expired,
and there has been a lot of noise about a new spec. I've collected a
test suite of HTML documents and created a DTD to parse them (with a
few minor tweaks.)

<p> Included are <a HREF="../../html-test/html.dtd">DTD for HTML</a>
that reflects current practice, along with a <a
HREF="../../html-test/">whole mess of HTML files I got from various
places to test it out</a>. This stuff has not been prepared for
distribution, but you can check out the <a
HREF="../../html-test/Makefile">Makefile</a> for clues.

href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html">1993 November: HTML+
Discussion Document; Dave Raggett</a>

<DD> Dave Ragget is working on a successor to HTML called HTML+. It is
now supported by Bill Perry's w3 mode for emacs and by tkWWW. <A
HREF="../../drafts/htmlplus-comments.html">My comments</A> on the HTML+
spec are under development.

1993 July: <CODE><A name="i-d"

<dd>
  <CITE>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): A Representation of Textual 
  Information and MetaInformation for Retrieval and 
  Interchange</CITE>
  
<DD>This internet draft (now expired) was "sponsored" by the
<em>Integration of Internet Information Resources</em> (IIIR) working
group of the <em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em> (IETF).<p>

It was submitted as a specification for a MIME content type called
<CODE>text/html</CODE>.

<DT>1991 
<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">
HyperText Mark-up Language; by Tim Berners-Lee
</A>

<DD>Tim Berners-Lee originally drafted this as a somewhat informal
reference on the HTML elements. The document has been edited
continuously since then, with snapshots published through various means.
