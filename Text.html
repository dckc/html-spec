<H1>Structured Text</H1>

<P>An HTML instance is like a text file,
except that some of the characters are interpreted as markup.
The markup gives structure to the document.

<P>The instance represents a hierarchy of elements.
Each element has a <A HREF="#name" NAME="z0">name</A> ,
some <A HREF="#attribute" NAME="z1">attributes</A> ,
and some content. Most elements are represented in the document
as a start tag, which gives the name and attributes,
followed by the content, followed by the end tag.
For example:

<PRE>		&lt;HTML&#62;
		 &lt;TITLE&#62;
		  A sample HTML instance
		 &lt;/TITLE&#62;
		 &lt;H1&#62;
		  An Example of Structure
		 &lt;/H1&#62;
		 Here's a typical paragraph.
		 &lt;P&#62;
		 &lt;UL&#62;
		  &lt;LI&#62;
		  Item one has an
		  &lt;A NAME="anchor"&#62;
		   anchor
		  &lt;/A&#62;
		  &lt;LI&#62;
		  Here's item two.
		 &lt;/UL&#62;
		&lt;/HTML&#62;

</PRE>

<P>Some elements (e.g. P, LI) are empty.
They have no content. They show up as just a start tag.

<P>For the rest of the elements, the content is a sequence of
data characters and nested elements. Note that the HTML DTD in
fact severely limits the amount of nesting which is allowed:
most things cannot be nested, in fact. No elements may be recursively
nested. Anchors and character highlighting may be put inside
other constructs.

<H2><A NAME="Tags">Tags</A></H2>

<P>Every element starts with a tag, and every non-empty element
ends with a tag. Start tags are delimited by &lt;and &#62;,
and end tags are delimited by &lt;/ and &#62;.

<H3><A NAME="name">Names</A></H3>

<P>The element name immediately follows the tag open delimiter.
Names consist of a letter followed by up to 33 letters,
digits, periods, or hyphens. Names are not case sensitive.

<H3><A NAME="attribute">Attributes</A></H3>

<P>In a start tag, whitespace and attributes are allowed between
the element name and the closing delimiter.
An attribute consists of a name, an equal sign,
and a value. Whitespace is allowed around the equal sign.

<P>The value is specified in a string surrounded by single quotes
or a string surrounded by double quotes.
(See: <A HREF="tolerated.html#attrval" NAME="z2">other tolerated
forms</A> @@)

<P>The string is parsed like RCDATA (see <A
HREF="#RCDATA" NAME="z3">below</A> ) to determine the attribute
value. This allows, for example, quote characters in attribute
values to be represented by character references.

<P>The length of an attribute value (after parsing) is limited
to 1024 characters.

<H2>Element Types</H2>

<P>The name of a tag refers to an element type declaration in
the HTML DTD. An element type declaration associates an element
name with

<UL>

<LI>A list of attributes and their types and statuses

<LI>A content type (one of EMPTY, CDATA,
RCDATA, ELEMENT, or MIXED) which determines the syntax of the
element's content

<LI>A content model, which specifies the pattern of nested elements
and data
</UL>

<H3>Empty Elements</H3>

<P>Empty elements have the keyword EMPTY in their declaration.
For example:

<PRE>	&lt;!ELEMENT NEXTID - O EMPTY&#62;
	&lt;!ATTLIST NEXTID N NUMBER #REQUIRED&#62;

</PRE>

<P>This means that the following:

<PRE>	&lt;nextid n=''27''&#62;

</PRE>

<P>is legal, but these others are not:

<PRE>	&lt;nextid&#62;
	&lt;nextid n=''abc''&#62;

</PRE>

<H3>Character Data</H3>

<P>The keyword CDATA indicates that the content of an element
is character data. Character data is all the text up to the next
end tag open delimiter-in-context. For example:

<PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT XMP - - CDATA&#62;
</PRE>

<P>specifies that the following text is a legal XMP element:

<PRE>	&lt;xmp&#62;Here's an example. It looks like it has
	&lt;tags&#62; and &lt;!--comments--&#62;
	in it, but it does not. Even this
	&lt;/ is data.&lt;/xmp&#62;

</PRE>

<P>The string &lt;/ is only recognized as the opening delimiter
of an end tag when it is ``in context,'' that is,
when it is followed by a letter. However,
as soon as the end tag open delimiter is recognized,
it terminates the CDATA content. The following is an error:

<PRE>	&lt;xmp&#62;There is no way to represent &lt;/end&#62; tags
	in CDATA &lt;/xmp&#62;

</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="RCDATA">Replaceable Character Data</A></H3>

<P>Elements with RCDATA content behave much like those with CDATA,
except for character references and entity references.
Elements declared like:

<PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT TITLE - - RCDATA&#62;
</PRE>

<P>can have any sequence of characters in their content.

<H4><A NAME="z4">Character References</A></H4>

<P>To represent a character that would otherwise be recognized
as markup, use a character reference. The string &amp;# signals
a character reference when it is followed by a letter or a digit.
The delimiter is followed by the decimal character number and
a semicolon. For example:

<PRE>&lt;title&#62;You can even represent &amp;#60;/end&#62; tags in RCDATA &lt;/title&#62;

</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="z5">Entity References</A></H4>

<P>The HTML DTD declares entities for the less than,
greater than, and ampersand characters and each of the ISO Latin
1 characters so that you can reference them by name rather than
by number.

<P>The string &amp;signals an entity reference when it is followed
by a letter or a digit. The delimiter is followed by the entity
name and a semicolon. For example:

<PRE>Kurt G&amp;ouml;del was a famous logician and mathematician.

</PRE>

<DL>

<DT>Note:

<DD>To be sure that a string of characters has no markup,
HTML writers should represent all occurrences of &lt;,
&#62;, and &amp;by character or entity references.
</DL>

<H3>Element Content</H3>

<P>Some elements have, in stead of a keyword that states the
type of content, a content model, which tells what patterns of
data and nested elements are allowed. If the content model of
an element does not include the symbol #PCDATA ,
the content is element content.

<P>Whitespace in element content is considered markup and ignored.
Any characters that are not markup, that is,
data characters, are illegal.

<P>For example:

<PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT HEAD - - (TITLE? &amp; ISINDEX? &amp; NEXTID? &amp; LINK*)&#62;
</PRE>

<P>declares an element that may be used as follows:

<PRE>&lt;head&#62;
 &lt;isindex&#62;
 &lt;title&#62;Head Example&lt;/title&#62;
&lt;/head&#62;
</PRE>

<P>But the following are illegal:

<PRE>&lt;head&#62; no data allowed! &lt;/head&#62;
&lt;head&#62;&lt;isindex&#62;&lt;title&#62;Two isindex tags&lt;/title&#62;&lt;isindex&#62;&lt;/head&#62;

</PRE>

<H3>Mixed Content</H3>

<P>If the content model includes the symbol #PCDATA,
the content of the element is parsed as mixed content.
For example:

<PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT PRE - - (#PCDATA | A | B | I | U | P)+&#62;
&lt;!ATTLIST PRE
	WIDTH NUMBER #implied
	&#62;
</PRE>

<P>This says that the PRE element contains one or more A,
B, I, U, or P elements or data characters.
Here's an example of a PRE element:

<PRE>&lt;pre&#62;
&lt;b&#62;NAME&lt;/b&#62;
    cat -- concatenate&lt;a href=''terms.html#file''&#62;files&lt;/a&#62;
&lt;b&#62;EXAMPLE&lt;/b&#62;
    cat &lt;xyz
&lt;/pre&#62;
</PRE>

<P>The content of the above PRE element is:

<UL>

<LI>A B element

<LI>The string `` cat -- concatenate''

<LI>An A element

<LI>The string ``\n''

<LI>Another B element

<LI>The string ``\n cat &lt;xyz''
</UL>

<H2>Comments and Other Markup</H2>

<P>To include comments in an HTML document that will be ignored
by the parser, surround them with &lt;!-- and --&#62;.
After the comment delimiter, all text up to the next occurrence
of -- is ignored. Hence comments cannot be nested.
Whitespace is allowed between the closing -- and &#62;.
(But not between the opening &lt;! and --.)

<P>For example:

<PRE>&lt;HEAD&#62;
&lt;TITLE&#62;HTML Guide: Recommended Usage&lt;/TITLE&#62;
&lt;!-- Id: Text.html,v 1.6 1994/04/25 17:33:48 connolly Exp --&#62;
&lt;/HEAD&#62;
 
</PRE>

<P>There are a few other SGML markup constructs that are deprecated
or illegal.

<DL>

<DT>Delimiter

<DD>Signals...

<DT>&lt;?

<DD>Processing instruction. Terminated by &#62;.

<DT>&lt;![

<DD>Marked section. Marked sections are deprecated.
See the SGML standard for complete information.

<DT>&lt;!

<DD>Markup declaration. HTML defines no short reference maps,
so these are errors. Terminated by &#62;.
</DL>

<H2>Line Breaks</H2>

<P>A line break character is considered markup (and ignored)
if it is the first or last piece of content in an element.
This allows you to write either

<PRE>&lt;PRE&#62;some example text&lt;/pre&#62;
</PRE>

<P>or

<PRE>&lt;pre&#62;
some example text
&lt;/pre&#62;
</PRE>

<P>and these will be processed identically.

<P>Also, a line that's not empty but contains no content will
be ignored altogether. For example, the element

<PRE>&lt;pre&#62;
&lt;!-- this line is ignored, including the linebreak character --&#62;
first line
 
third line&lt;!-- the following linebreak is content: --&#62;
fourth line&lt;!-- this one's ignored because it's the last piece of content: --&#62;
&lt;/pre&#62;
</PRE>

<P>contains only the strings

<PRE>
 first line

 third line
 fourth line.

</PRE>

<H2>Spaces and Tabs</H2>

<P>Space characters must be rendered as horizontal white space.
In HTML, multiple spaces should be rendered as single spaces.

<P>The rendering of a horizontal tab (HT) character is not defined,
and HT should therefore not be used, except within a <A
HREF="Elements/PRE.html" NAME="z6">PRE</A> (or obsolete XMP,
LISTING or PLAINTEXT) element.

<P>Neither spaces nor tabs should be used to make SGML source
layout more attractive or easier to read.

<H2>Summary of Markup Signals</H2>

<P>The following delimiters may signal markup,
depending on context.

<DD>Signals

<DT>&lt;!--
