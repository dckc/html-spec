<H1>Structured Text</H1>

<P>An HTML instance is like a text file,
except that some of the characters are interpreted as markup.
The markup gives structure to the document.

<P>The instance represents a hierarchy of elements.
Each element has a <A HREF="#name" NAME="z0">name</A> ,
some <A HREF="#attribute" NAME="z1">attributes</A> ,
and some content. Most elements are represented in the document
as a start tag, which gives the name and attributes,
followed by the content, followed by the end tag.
For example:

<PRE>
	&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC
	 	"-//connolly hal.com//DTD WWW HTML Date 1994/04/19 17:24:06 //EN"&#62;
	&#60;HTML&#62;
	  &#60;HEAD&#62;
	    &#60;TITLE&#62;
	      A sample HTML document
	    &#60;/TITLE&#62;
	  &#60;/HEAD&#62;

	      An Example of Structure
	      &#60;br&#62;
	      In HTML
	    &#60;/H1&#62;
	    &#60;P&#62;
	      Here's a typical paragraph.
	    &#60;UL&#62;
	      &#60;LI&#62;
	        Item one has an
	        &#60;A NAME="anchor"&#62;
	          anchor
	        &#60;/A&#62;
	      &#60;LI&#62;
	        Here's item two.
	    &#60;/UL&#62;
	  &#60;/BODY&#62;
	&#60;/HTML&#62;

</PRE>

<P>Some elements (e.g. <CODE>BR</CODE>) are empty.
They have no content. They show up as just a start tag.

<P>For the rest of the elements, the content is a sequence of
data characters and nested elements. Note that the HTML DTD in
fact severely limits the amount of nesting which is allowed:
most things cannot be nested, in fact. No elements may be recursively
nested. Anchors and character highlighting may be put inside
other constructs.

<H2><A NAME="Tags">Tags</A></H2>

<P>Most elements start and end with tags.
Empty elements have no end tag. Start tags are delimited by &#60;and
&#62;, and end tags are delimited by &#60;/ and &#62;.
For example:

<PRE>
	&#60;h1&#62; ... &#60;/H1&#62;   &#60;!-- uppercase = lowercase  --&#62;
	&#60;h1 &#62; ... &#60;/h1 &#62; &#60;!-- spaces OK before &#62; --&#62;
</PRE>

<P>The following are <EM>not</EM> valid tags:

<PRE>
	&#60; h1&#62;             &#60;!-- this is not a tag at all --&#62;
	&#60;H1/&#62; &#60;H=1&#62;       &#60;!-- these are markup errors --&#62;
</PRE>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>The SGML declaration for HTML specifies <CODE>SHORTTAG
YES</CODE>, which means that there are some other valid syntaxes
for tags, e.g. NET tags: <CODE>&#60;em/.../</CODE>,
empty start tags: <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>,
empty end tags: <CODE>&#60;/&#62;</CODE>.
Until such time as support for these idioms is widely deployed,
their use is strongly discouraged.</EM>
</DL>

<P>The start and end tags for the HTML, HEAD,
and BODY elements are omissable. The end tags of some other elements
(e.g. P, LI, DT, DD) can be ommitted (see the DTD for details).
This does not change the document structure -- the following
documents are equivalent:

<PRE>
	&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC
	 	"-//connolly hal.com//DTD WWW HTML Date 1994/04/19 17:24:06 //EN"&#62;

	  &#60;H1&#62;Structural Example&#60;/H1&#62;
	  &#60;P&#62;A paragraph...

	&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC
	 	"-//connolly hal.com//DTD WWW HTML Date 1994/04/19 17:24:06 //EN"&#62;
	  &#60;HTML&#62;&#60;HEAD&#62;
	  &#60;TITLE&#62;Structural Example&#60;/TITLE&#62;
	  &#60;/HEAD&#62;
	  &#60;BODY&#62;
	  &#60;H1&#62;Structural Example&#60;/H1&#62;
	  &#60;P&#62;A paragraph...&#60;/P&#62;
	  &#60;/BODY&#62;
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="name">Names</A></H3>

<P>The element name immediately follows the tag open delimiter.
Names consist of a letter followed by up to 33 letters,
digits, periods, or hyphens. Names are not case sensitive.
For example:

<PRE>
	A H1 h1 another.name name-with-hyphens
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="attribute">Attributes</A></H3>

<P>In a start tag, whitespace and attributes are allowed between
the element name and the closing delimiter.
An attribute consists of a name, an equal sign,
and a value. Whitespace is allowed around the equal sign.

<P>The value is either:

<UL>

<LI>A string literal, delimited by single quotes or double quotes,
or

<LI>A name token; that is, a sequence of letters,
digits, periods, or hyphens.
</UL>

<P>For example:

<PRE>
	&#60;A HREF="http://host/dir/file.html"&#62;
	&#60;A HREF=foo.html &#62;
	&#60;IMG SRC="mrbill.gif" ALT="Mr. Bill says, &#38;#34;Oh Noooo&#38;#34;"&#62;
</PRE>

<P>The length of an attribute value (after replacing entity and
numeric character referencees) is limited to 1024 characters.

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>NOTE 1:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>Some implementations allowed any character except space
or '&#62;' in a name token, for example <CODE>&#60;A HREF=foo/bar.html&#62;</CODE>.
As a result, there are many documents that contain attribute
values that should be quoted but are not.
While parser implementators are encouraged to support this idiom,
its use in future documents is stictly prohibited.</EM>

<DT><STRONG>NOTE 2:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>Some implementations also consider any occurence of the
<CODE>&#62;</CODE> character to signal the end of a tag.
For compatibility with such implementations,
it may be necessary to represent <CODE>&#62;</CODE> with an entity
or numeric character reference; for example:
<CODE>&#60;IMG SRC="eq1.ps" ALT="a &#38;#62;
b"&#62;</CODE></EM>
</DL>

<P>Attributes with a delcared value of <CODE>NAME</CODE> (e.g.
<CODE>ISMAP</CODE>, <CODE>COMPACT</CODE>) may be written using
a minimized syntax. The markup:

<PRE>
	&#60;UL COMPACT="COMPACT"&#62;
</PRE>
can be written as
<PRE>
	&#60;UL COMPACT&#62;
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="Data">Character Data</A></H2>

<P>The charcters between the tags represent text in the ISO-Latin-1
character set, which is a superset of ASCII.
Because certain characters will be interpreted as markup,
they should be "escaped"; that is, represented by markup -- entity
or numeric character references. For example:

<PRE>
When a&#38;#60;b, we can show that...
Brought to you by AT&#38;amp;T
</PRE>

<P>The HTML DTD includes entities for each of the non-ASCII characters
so that one may reference them by name if it is inconvenient
to enter them directly:

<PRE>Kurt G&#38;ouml;del was a famous logician and mathematician.

</PRE>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>NOTE 1:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>To ensure that a string of characters has no markup,
it is sufficient to represent all occurrences of <CODE>&#60;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#62;</CODE>, and <CODE>&#38;</CODE> by character or entity
references. </EM>


<DT><STRONG>NOTE 2:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>There are SGML features (<CODE>CDATA</CODE>,
<CODE>RCDATA</CODE>) to allow most <CODE>&#60;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#62;</CODE>, and <CODE>&#38;</CODE> characters to be entered
without the use of entity or character references.
Because these features tend to be used and implemented incosistently,
they are not employed in this version of the HTML DTD.</EM>
<P><EM>An earlier HTML specification included an <CODE>XMP</CODE>
element whose syntax is not expressible in SGML.
Inside the <CODE>XMP</CODE>, no markup was recognized except
the <CODE>&#60;/XMP&#62;</CODE> end tag.
While implementations are encouraged to support this idiom,
its use is obsolete. </EM>


</DL>

<H3>Comments</H3>

<P>To include comments in an HTML document that will be ignored
by the parser, surround them with &#60;!-- and --&#62;.
After the comment delimiter, all text up to the next occurrence
of -- is ignored. Hence comments cannot be nested.
Whitespace is allowed between the closing -- and &#62;.
(But not between the opening &#60;! and --.)

<P>For example:

<PRE>&#60;HEAD&#62;
&#60;TITLE&#62;HTML Guide: Recommended Usage&#60;/TITLE&#62;
