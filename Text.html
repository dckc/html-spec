<H1>Text and Markup</H1>

This part of <A HREF="HTML.html">the HTML reference</A> is
an explanation of SGML syntax as it applies to HTML. For lexical
issues, the purpose is to take the standard and reduce it from the
abstract system that is SGML to a concrete language, HTML. For
structural issues, the purpose is to give you enough background to
read <A HREF="html.dtd">the DTD</A>.
<P>

<H2>Structured Text</H2>

An HTML document is a hierarchy of <dfn>elements</dfn>. Each element
has a <A HREF="#name">name</A>, some <A
HREF="#attribute">attributes</A>, and some <dfn>content</dfn>. Most
elements are represented in the document as a <dfn>start tag</dfn>,
which gives the name and attributes, followed by the content, followed
by the <dfn>end tag</dfn>. For example:
<P>

<PRE>
&#60;HTML>
 &#60;TITLE>
  A sample HTML document
 &#60;/TITLE>
 &#60;H1>
  An Example of Structure
 &#60;/H1>
 Here's a typical paragraph.
 &#60;P>
 &#60;UL>
  &#60;LI>
  Item one has an
  &#60;A NAME="anchor">
   anchor
  &#60;/A>
  &#60;LI>
  Here's item two.
 &#60;/UL>
&#60;/HTML>
</PRE>

Some elements (e.g. P, LI) are <dfn>empty</dfn>. They have no content.
They show up as just a start tag.
<P>

For the rest of the elements, the content is a sequence of <dfn>data
characters</dfn> and nested elements. The content must match the
element's model group from its declaration in <A HREF="html.dtd">the
DTD</A>.
<P>

Using the example from above, the content of the <code>UL</code>
element is the sequence <samp>LI, #PCDATA, A, LI, #PCDATA</samp>. This
matches the model group from the <code>UL</code> element declaration:
<code>(#PCDATA|LI|A)+</code>.

<H2>Parsing Content Into Data and Markup</H2>

An HTML document is like a text file, except that some of the
characters are interpreted as markup, rather than document content.

The following table lists the special character sequences that
separate data from markup in an HTML document.

<H3><A NAME="delimiters">SGML delimiters</A></H3>

<DL>

<DT>CRO<DD>Character Reference Open: <samp>&#38;#</samp>, when
followed by a letter or a digit, signals a <A HREF="#CREF">character
reference</A>.

<DT>ERO<DD>Entity Reference Open: <samp>&#38;</samp>, when followed by
a letter, signals an <A HREF="#Entities">entity reference</A>.

<DT><A NAME="ETAGO">ETAGO</A><DD>End Tag Open: <samp>&#60;/</samp>,
when followed by a letter, signals an <A HREF="#Tags">end tag.
</A>

<DT>MDO<DD>Markup Declaration Open: <samp>&#60;!</samp>, when followed
by a letter or <samp>--</samp> or <samp>[</samp>, signals one of
several SGML markup declarations. The <A HREF="#Comments">comment</A>
declaration is the most useful. Marked sections are deprecated in
HTML. USEMAP declarations are errors, since SHORTTAG is not supported.

<DT>MSC<DD>Marked Section Close: <samp>]]</samp>, when followed by
<samp>></samp> signals the end of a marked section. While marked
sections are not used in HTML, this sequence of characters is
recognized and reported as an error by conforming SGML parsers.

<DT>PIO<DD>Processing Instruction Open: <samp>&#60;?</samp> signals a
processing instruction. It is not used in HTML.

<DT>STAGO<DD>Start Tag Open: <samp>&#60;</samp>, when followed by a
letter, signals a <A HREF="#Tags">start tag</A>.

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="PCDATA">Parsed Character Data</A></H3>

In <A HREF="html.dtd">the DTD</A>, the keyword PCDATA stands for
<dfn>parsed character data</dfn>, the normal text characters in an
HTML document.
<P>

All of the SGML delimiters listed in <A HREF="#delimiters">the table
of delimiters</A>are recognized in PCDATA.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="CDATA">Character Data</A></H3>

The keyword CDATA stands for <dfn>character data</dfn>, the text
without markup in an SGML document. Only the end tag open <A
HREF="#delimiters">delimiter</A> is recognized in CDATA.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="RCDATA">Replaceable Character Data</A></H3>

The keyword RCDATA stands for <dfn>replaceable character data</dfn>,
the text without tags in an SGML document. The character reference
open, entity reference open, and end tag open <A
HREF="#delimiters">delimiters
</A>
are recognized in RCDATA.
<P>

Note that there is no way to include an end tag open
delimiter-in-context in CDATA. Any sequence of characters is
representable in replaceable character data through numeric character
references, if necessary.

<H2><A NAME="Tags">Tags</A></H2>

The characters in an SGML document are organized into a heirarchy of
elements by the use of tags. Tags are set off from the data characters
by angle brackets: '&#60;' and '&#62;'.<P>

<H3><A NAME="name">Names</A></H3>

The element name immediately follows "&#60;". Names consist of a letter
followed by up to 33 letters, digits, periods, or hyphens. Names are
not case sensitive.<P>

<H3><A NAME="attribute">Attributes</A></H3>

Following the element name, whitespace and attributes are allowed. An
attribute consists of a name, an equal sign, and a value. Spaces are
allowed around the equal sign.<P>

The value is specified in a string surrounded by single quotes or a
string surrounded by double quotes. (See:
<A HREF="tolerated.html#attrval">other tolerated forms</A>) Entity
references are processed inside attribute values as inside PCDATA. The
length of an attribute value (after entity processing) is limited to
1024 characters.
<P>

Each attribute has a type, which puts constraints on the values it can
have. For example, the NAME attribute of the A element is a NMTOKEN.
An NMTOKEN must consist entirely of name characters: letters, digits,
periods, and hyphens.

<H2><A NAME="CREF">Numeric Character References</A></H2>

In order to include characters that would otherwise be parsed as
markup, you can use numeric character references to refer to some
characters.
<P>

A numeric character reference is an ampersand, followed by a number,
followed by a semicolon. No spaces are allowed within a character
reference. For example:
<P>

<PRE>
This is how you include a &#38;#60;tag&#38;#62; as data.
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="Entities">Entities</A></H2>

Entities refer to data that are not representable by SGML tags or data
characters. HTML defines entities for each of the ISO Latin 1
characters.<P>

An entity reference is an ampersand, followed by a name, followed by a
semicolon. No spaces are allowed within an entity reference. For
example:<P>

<PRE>
Kurt G&#38;ouml;del was a famous metamathemetician.
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="Comments">Comments</A></H2>

Comment declarations can be used include information aimed at persons
and tools that read the document in source form. This information will
be ignored when the document is processed by an SGML parser.<P>

Comments begin with the character sequence "&#60;!--" and end with
"--", which must be followed by '&#62;'. (Technically, whitespace is
allowed between the closing "--" and '&#62;'.)<P>

Note that the markup delcaration open delimiter("&#60;!") that begins a
comment is not recognized in <A HREF="#RCDATA">RCDATA</A> or <A
HREF="#CDATA">CDATA</A>.
