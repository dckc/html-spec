</HEAD><BODY><H1>Structured Text
</H1>
An HTML instance is like a text file, except that some of the characters are interpreted as markup. The markup gives structure to the document.<P>

The instance represents a hierarchy of elements. Each element has a <A HREF="#name">name
</A>, some <A HREF="#attribute">attributes
</A>, and some content. Most elements are represented in the document as a start tag, which gives the name and attributes, followed by the content, followed by the end tag. For example: <P>
<PRE>&#60;HTML&#62;
 &#60;TITLE&#62;
  A sample HTML instance
 &#60;/TITLE&#62;
 &#60;H1&#62;
  An Example of Structure
 &#60;/H1&#62;
 Here's a typical paragraph.
 &#60;P&#62;
 &#60;UL&#62;
  &#60;LI&#62;
  Item one has an
  &#60;A NAME="anchor"&#62;
   anchor
  &#60;/A&#62;
  &#60;LI&#62;
  Here's item two.
 &#60;/UL&#62;
&#60;/HTML&#62;
</PRE>
Some elements (e.g. P, LI) are empty. They have no content. They show up as just a start tag. <P>

For the rest of the elements, the content is a sequence of data characters and nested elements.<P>

<H2><A NAME="Tags">Tags
</A>
</H2>
Every element starts with a tag, and every non-empty element ends with a tag. Start tags are delimited by &#60; and &#62;, and end tags are delimited by &#60;/ and &#62;. <P>

<H3><A NAME="name">Names
</A>
</H3>
The element name immediately follows the tag open delimiter. Names consist of a letter followed by up to 33 letters, digits, periods, or hyphens. Names are not case sensitive.<P>

<H3><A NAME="attribute">Attributes
</A>
</H3>
In a start tag, whitespace and attributes are allowed between the element name and the closing delimiter. An attribute consists of a name, an equal sign, and a value. Whitespace is allowed around the equal sign.<P>

The value is specified in a string surrounded by single quotes or a string surrounded by double quotes. (See: <A HREF="tolerated.html#attrval">other tolerated forms
</A>@@)<P>

The string is parsed like RCDATA (see <A HREF="#RCDATA">below
</A>) to determine the attribute value. This allows, for example, quote characters in attribute values to be represented by character references.<P>

The length of an attribute value (after parsing) is limited to 1024 characters. <P>

<H2>Element Types
</H2>
The name of a tag refers to an element type declaration in the HTML DTD. An element type declaration associates an element name with<P>

<UL><LI>A list of attributes and their types and statuses
<LI>A content type (one of EMPTY, CDATA, RCDATA, ELEMENT, or MIXED) which determines the syntax of the element's content
<LI>A content model, which specifies the pattern of nested elements and data

</UL><H3>Empty Elements
</H3>
Empty elements have the keyword EMPTY in their declaration. For example:<P>
<PRE>&#60;!ELEMENT NEXTID - O EMPTY&#62;
&#60;!ATTLIST NEXTID N NUMBER #REQUIRED&#62;
</PRE>
This means that the follwing:<P>
<PRE>&lt;nextid n=''27''>
</PRE>
is legal, but these others are not:<P>
<PRE>&#60;nextid&#62;
</PRE><PRE>&lt;nextid n=''abc''>
</PRE>
<H3>Character Data
</H3>
The keyword CDATA indicates that the content of an element is character data. Character data is all the text up to the next end tag open delimter-in-context. For example:<P>
<PRE>&#60;!ELEMENT XMP - - CDATA&#62;
</PRE>
specifies that the following text is a legal XMP element:<P>
<PRE>&lt;xmp>Here's a title. It looks like it has &lt;tags> and &lt;!--comments-->
in it, but it does not. Even this &#60;/ is data.&#60;/xmp&#62;
</PRE>
The string &#60;/ is only recognized as the opening delimiter of an end tag when it is ``in context,'' that is, when it is followed by a letter. However, as soon as the end tag open delimiter is recognized, it terminates the CDATA content. The following is an error:<P>
<PRE>&#60;xmp&#62;There is no way to represent &#60;/end&#62; tags in CDATA &#60;/xmp&#62;
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="RCDATA">Replaceable Character Data
</A>
</H3>
Elements with RCDATA content behave much like thos with CDATA, except for character references and entity references. Elements declared like:<P>
<PRE>&#60;!ELEMENT TITLE - - RCDATA&#62;
</PRE>
can have any sequence of characters in their content.<P>

<H4>Character References
</H4>
To represent a character that would otherwise be recognized as markup, use a character referece. The string &#38;# signals a character reference when it is followed by a letter or a digit. The delimiter is followed by the decimal character number and a semicolon. For example:<P>
<PRE>&#60;title&#62;You can even represent &#38;#60;/end&#62; tags in RCDATA &#60;/title&#62;
</PRE>
<H4>Entity References
</H4>
The HTML DTD declares entities for the less than, greater than, and ampersand characters and each of the ISO Latin 1 characters so that you can reference them by name rather than by number.<P>

The string &#38; signals an entity reference when it is followed by a letter or a digit. The delimiter is followed by the entity name and a semicolon. For example:<P>
<PRE>Kurt G&#38;ouml;del was a famous logician and mathemetician.
</PRE>
<DL><DT>Note:<DD>To be sure that a string of characters has no markup, HTML writers should represent all occurences of &#60;, &#62;, and &#38; by character or entity references.

</DL><H3>Element Content
</H3>
Some elements have, in stead of a keyword that states the type of content, a content model, which tells what patterns of data and nested elements are allowed. If the content model of an element does not include the symbol #PCDATA , the content is element content. <P>

Whitespace in element content is considered markup and ignored. Any characters that are not markup, that is, data characters, are illegal.<P>

For example:<P>
<PRE>&#60;!ELEMENT HEAD - - (TITLE? &#38; ISINDEX? &#38; NEXTID? &#38; LINK*)&#62;
</PRE>
declares an element that may be used as follows:<P>
<PRE>&#60;head&#62;
 &#60;isindex&#62;
 &#60;title&#62;Head Example&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;
</PRE>
But the following are illegal:<P>
<PRE>&#60;head&#62; no data allowed! &#60;/head&#62;
</PRE><PRE>&#60;head&#62;&#60;isindex&#62;&#60;title&#62;Two isindex tags&#60;/title&#62;&#60;isindex&#62;&#60;/head&#62;
</PRE>
<H3>Mixed Content
</H3>
If the content model includes the symbol #PCDATA, the content of the element is parsed as mixed content. For example:<P>
<PRE>&#60;!ELEMENT PRE - - (#PCDATA | A | B | I | U | P)+&#62;
&#60;!ATTLIST PRE
	WIDTH NUMBER #implied
</PRE><PRE>	&#62;
</PRE>
This says that the PRE element contains one or more A, B, I, U, or P elements or data characters. Here's an example of a PRE element:<P>
<PRE>&#60;pre&#62;
</PRE><PRE>&#60;b&#62;NAME&#60;/b&#62;
</PRE><PRE>    cat -- concatenate&lt;a href=''terms.html#file''>files&lt;/a>
</PRE><PRE>&#60;b&#62;EXAMPLE&#60;/b&#62;
</PRE><PRE>    cat &#38;#60;xyz
</PRE><PRE>&#60;/pre&#62;
</PRE>
The content of the above PRE element is:<P>

<UL><LI>A B element
<LI>The string ``   cat -- concatenate''
<LI>An A element
<LI>The string ``\n''
<LI>Another B element
<LI>The string ``\n   cat &lt;xyz''

</UL><H2>Comments and Other Markup
</H2>
To include comments in an HTML document that will be ignored by the parser, surround them with &#60;!-- and --&#62;. After the comment delimiter, all text up to the next occurence of -- is ignored. Hence comments cannot be nested. Whitespace is allowed between the closing -- and &#62;. (But not between the opening &#60;! and --.)<P>

For example:<P>
<PRE>&#60;HEAD&#62;
&#60;TITLE&#62;HTML Guide: Recommended Usage&#60;/TITLE&#62;
&#60;!-- $Id$ --&#62;
&#60;/HEAD&#62;
</PRE><PRE> 
</PRE>
There are a few other SGML markup constructs that are deprecated or illegal.<P>

<DL><DT>Delimiter<DD>Signals...
<DT>&#60;?<DD>Processing instruction. Terminated by &#62;. 
<DT>&#60;![L<DD>Marked section. Marked sections are deprecated. See the SGML standard for complete information.
<DT>&#60;!L<DD>Markup declaration. HTML defines no short reference maps, so these are errors. Terminated by &#62;.

</DL><H2>Line Breaks
</H2>
A line break character is considered markup (and ignored) if it is the first or last piece of content in an element. This allows you to write either<P>
<PRE>&#60;PRE&#62;some example text&#60;/pre&#62;
</PRE>
or<P>
<PRE>&#60;pre&#62;
some example text
&#60;/pre&#62;
</PRE>
and these will be processed identically.<P>

Also, a line that's not empty but contains no content will be ignored altogether. For example, the element<P>
<PRE>&#60;pre&#62;
</PRE><PRE>&#60;!-- this line is ignored, including the linebreak character --&#62;
</PRE><PRE>first line
</PRE><PRE> 
</PRE><PRE>third line&#60;!-- the following linebreak is content: --&#62;
</PRE><PRE>fourth line&lt;!-- this one's ignored cuz it's the last piece of content: -->
</PRE><PRE>&#60;/pre&#62;
</PRE>
contains only the string first line\n\nthird line\nfourth line.<P>

<H2>Summary of Markup Signals
</H2>
The following delimiters may signal markup, depending on context.<P>

<DL><DT>Delimiter<DD>Signals
<DT>&#60;!--<DD>Comment
<DT>&#38;#<DD>Character reference
<DT>&#38;<DD>Entity reference
<DT>&#60;/<DD>End tag
<DT>&#60;!<DD>Markup declaration
