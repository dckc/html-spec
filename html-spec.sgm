<Abstract>
The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used
to create hypertext documents that are platform independent.  HTML
documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are
appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
domains. HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail,
documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query
results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and
hypertext views of existing bodies of information.

HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web (WWW) global information
initiative since 1990. This specification roughly corresponds to the
capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994. HTML is an
application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and
Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).

The <code>text/html</> Internet Media Type (RFC&nbsp;1590)
and MIME Content Type (RFC&nbsp;1521) is defined by this specification.

<h1 id=security>Security Considerations

Anchors, embedded images, and all other elements which contain URIs as
parameters may cause the URI to be dereferenced in response to user
input. In this case, the security considerations of [URL] apply.
  
The widely deployed methods for submitting forms requests &mdash; HTTP and
SMTP &mdash; provide little assurance of confidentiality. Information
providers who request sensitive information via forms &mdash; especially by
way of the <code/PASSWORD/ type input field (see <hdref refid=input>)
&mdash; should be aware and make their users aware of the lack of
confidentiality.
