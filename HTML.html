<P>This document is an Internet Draft. Internet Drafts are working
documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other groups may
also distribute working documents as Internet Drafts.

<P>Internet Drafts are working documents valid for a maximum
of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated,
replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.
It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material
or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress".

<P>Distribution of this document is unlimited.
The document is a draft form of a standard for interchange of
information on the network which is proposed to be registered
as a MIME (RFC1521) content type. Please send comments to connolly@hal.com
or the discussion list www-talk@info.cern.ch.

<P>This is version 1.3 of this draft. This document is available

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P><!-- HREF="MarkUp.html" --><A NAME="z14">HyperText Markup
Language</A> (HTML) can be used to represent

<UL>

<LI>Hypertext news, mail, online documentation,
and collaborative hypermedia;

<LI>Menus of options;

<LI>Database query results;

<LI>Simple structured documents with inlined graphics.

<LI>Hypertext views of existing bodies of information
</UL>

<P>The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links related information
throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing
linked information, and all W3 compatible programs are required
to be capable of handling HTML. W3 uses an Internet protocol
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer representations
to be negotiated between client and server,
the result being returned in an extended MIME message.
HTML is therefore just one, but an important one,
of the representations used with W3.

<P>HTML is proposed as a MIME content type.

<P>HTML refers to the URL specification of RFCxxxx.

<P>Implementations of HTML parsers and generators can be found
in the various W3 servers and browsers, in the public domain
W3 code, and may also be built using various public domain SGML
parsers such as <A HREF="References.html#z4"
NAME="z7">[SGMLS]</A> . HTML documents are SGML documents with
fairly generic semantics appropriate for representing information
from a wide range of applications.
