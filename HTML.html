<H1>HyperText Markup Language</H1>

A Representation for Nodes in the World Wide Web

<ADDRESS>Dan Connolly &#60;connolly@convex.com&#62;</ADDRESS>

<H3>Abstract</H3>

The World Wide Web project involves the processing of structured
documents by diverse systems around the globe. Existing systems geared
towards typesetting, information retrieval, or multimedia are too
tightly coupled to a hardware system, authoring environment,
publication style, or field of study.<P>

HyperText Markup Language was created to fill the need to
<UL>
<LI>Represent existing bodies of information
<LI>Connect information entities with hypertext links
<LI>Scale to a world-wide scope
<LI>Fit into existing and evolving user interface paradigms
<LI>Provide an experimental platform for collaborative hypermedia
</UL>


<H2>Specification</H2>

The HyperText Markup Language is defined in terms of
<A HREF="#SGML">Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</A>. The <A
HREF="html.dtd">HyperText Markup Language Document Type Definition
</A>
specifies the syntax and structure of HTML.
<P>

<H2>Implementors' Guide</H2>

This is intended as an introduction to the language and a guide to
implementors. It does not comprise an integral part of the HTML
specification.
<P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<A HREF="Text.html">Text and Markup</A> is an introduction to SGML
text and markup as it applies to HTML. It should prepare you to read
<A HREF="html.dtd">the DTD</A>.
<P>

<H3>HTML by Example</H3>

The following sections describe the HyperText Markup language by
example. They are organized in order of complexity, both for the human
reader and the SGML application.
<P>

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="recommended.html">Recommended</A>

<DD>Examples of how to write HTML that won't stress the processing
software. Some things can't be done this way.

<DT><A HREF="complete.html">Complete</A>

<DD>Examples of all the constructs necessary to produce HTML
documents.

<DT><A HREF="tolerated.html">Tolerated</A>

<DD>Examples of illegal constructs that are supported for historical
reasons.

<DT><A HREF="errors.html">Errors</A>

<DD>These are just plain broken. Implementors should use these to
bullet-proof their code.
