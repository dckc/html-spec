<H2>About of this Document</H2>

<P>This document describes the current practice and current proposals
for future standardisation of HTML, as a basis for review and
enhancement.

<P>The document is a draft form of a standard for interchange
of information on the network which is proposed to be registered
as a MIME (RFC1521) content type.

<P>Please send comments to connolly@hal.com or the discussion
list www-html@info.cern.ch.

<H3>Version</H3>

<P>This is version 2.0 of this document,
(released $Date$) It introduces forms for
user input of information, and adds a distinction between levels
of conformance. Level 0 is the minimum conformance level.
Level 1 includes phrase-level markup and images.
Level 2 includes forms. Features of higher levels which are under
discussion, (such as tables, figures, and mathematical formulae)
where mentioned are described as "proposed".

<P>The latest version of this document is currently available
in hypertext on the World-Wide Web as

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P><A NAME="z14">HyperText Markup Language</A> (HTML) can be
used to represent

<UL>

<LI>Hypertext news, mail, online documentation,
and collaborative hypermedia;

<LI>Menus of options;

<LI>Database query results;

<LI>Simple structured documents with inlined graphics.

<LI>Hypertext views of existing bodies of information
</UL>

<P>The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links related information
throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing
linked information, and all W3 compatible programs are required
to be capable of handling HTML. W3 uses an Internet protocol
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer representations
to be negotiated between client and server,
the result being returned in an extended MIME message.
HTML is therefore just one, but an important one,
of the representations used with W3.

<P>HTML is proposed as a MIME content type.

<P>HTML refers to the <A NAME="z21"
HREF="References.html#z7">URI</A> specification RFCxxxx.

<P>Implementations of HTML parsers and generators can be found
in the various <A NAME="z22"
HREF="References.html#z10">W3</A> servers and browsers,
in the public domain W3 code, and may also be built using various
public domain SGML parsers such as [SGMLS] .
HTML documents are SGML documents with fairly generic semantics
appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
applications.
