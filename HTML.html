<p>This document is an Internet Draft.
Internet Drafts are working documents
of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), its Areas, and its
Working Groups.  Note that other
groups may also distribute working
documents as Internet Drafts.<P>
Internet Drafts are working documents
valid for a maximum of six months.
Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced,
or  obsoleted by other documents
at any time.  It is not appropriate
to use Internet Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than
as a "working draft" or "work in
progress".<P>
Distribution of this document is
unlimited.   The document is a  draft
form of a standard for interchange
of information on the network which
is proposed  to be registered as
a MIME (RFC1341) content type. Please
send comments to timbl@info.cern.ch
or the discussion list www-talk@info.cern.ch.<P>
This is version 1.2 of this draft.

<p>The World Wide Web (W3) initiative
links related information throughout
the globe.  HTML provides one simple
format for providing linked information,
and  all W3 compatible programs are
required to be capable of handling
HTML.    W3 uses an Internet protocol
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP),
which allows transfer representations
to be negotiated between client and
server, the result being returned
in an extended MIME message.  HTML
is therefore just one, but an important
one, of the representations used
with W3.<P>
HTML is proposed as a  MIME content
type.<P>
HTML refers to the URL specification
of RFCxxxx.<P>
Implementations of HTML parsers and
generators can be found in the various
W3 servers and browsers, in the public
domain W3 code, and may also be built
using various public domain SGML
parsers such as <A
NAME="z7" HREF="References.html#z4">[SGMLS]</A> .  HTML is
an SGML document type with fairly
generic semantics appropriate for
representing information from a wide
range of applications.  It is more
generic than many specific SGML applications,
but is still completely device-independent.
