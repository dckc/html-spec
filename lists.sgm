<h2>List Elements

<p>HTML supports several types of lists, all of which may be nested.

<h3>Definition List

<![CDATA[
<DL> ... </DL>	Level 0
]]>

<p>A definition list is a list of terms and corresponding
definitions. Definition lists are typically formatted with the term
flush-left and the definition, formatted paragraph style, indented
after the term.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<DL>
<DT>Term<DD>This is the definition of the first term.
<DT>Term<DD>This is the definition of the second term.
</DL>
]]></listing>

<p>If the DT term does not fit in the DT column (one third of the
display area), it may be extended across the page with the DD section
moved to the next line, or it may be wrapped onto successive lines of
the left hand column.

<p>Single occurrences of a <tag/DT/ tag without a subsequent <tag/DD/ tag are
allowed, and have the same significance as if the <tag/DD/ tag had been
present with no text.

<p>The opening list tag must be <tag/DL/ and must be immediately followed
by the first term (<tag/DT/).

<p>The definition list type can take the COMPACT attribute, which
suggests that a compact rendering be used, because the list items are
small and/or the entire list is large.

<p>Unless you provide the COMPACT attribute, the HTML interpreter may
leave white space between successive DT, DD pairs. The COMPACT
attribute may also reduce the width of the left-hand (DT) column.

<p>If using the COMPACT attribute, the opening list tag must be <tag/DL
COMPACT/, which must be immediately followed by the first <tag/DT/ tag:

<listing><![CDATA[
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Term<DD>This is the first definition in compact format.
<DT>Term<DD>This is the second definition in compact format.
</DL>
]]></listing>

<h3>Directory List

<![CDATA[
<DIR> ... </DIR>	Level 0
]]>

<p>A Directory List element is used to present a list of items
containing up to 20 characters each. Items in a directory list may be
arranged in columns, typically 24 characters wide. If the HTML
interpreter can optimize the column width as function of the widths of
individual elements, so much the better.

<p>A directory list must begin with the <tag/DIR/ tag which is immediately
followed by a <tag/LI/ (list item) tag:

<listing><![CDATA[
<DIR>
<LI>A-H<LI>I-M
<LI>M-R<LI>S-Z
</DIR>
]]></listing>

<h3>Menu List

<![CDATA[
<MENU> ... </MENU>	Level 0
]]>

<p>A menu list is a list of items with typically one line per
item. The menu list style is more compact than the style of an
unordered list.

<p>A menu list must begin with a <tag/MENU/ tag which is immediately
followed by a <tag/LI/ (list item) tag:

<listing><![CDATA[
<MENU>
<LI>First item in the list.
<LI>Second item in the list.
<LI>Third item in the list.
</MENU>
]]></listing>

<h3>Ordered List

<![CDATA[
<OL> ... </OL>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Ordered List element is used to present a numbered list of
items, sorted by sequence or order of importance.

<p>An ordered list must begin with the <tag/OL/ tag which is immediately
followed by a <tag/LI/ (list item) tag:

<listing><![CDATA[
<OL>
<LI>Click the Web button to open the Open the URL window.
<LI>Enter the URL number in the text field of the Open URL 
window. The Web document you specified is displayed.
<LI>Click highlighted text to move from one link to another.
</OL>
]]></listing>

<p>The Ordered List element can take the COMPACT attribute, which
suggests that a compact rendering be used.

<h3>Unordered List

<![CDATA[
<UL> ... </UL>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Unordered List element is used to present a list of items which
is typically separated by white space and/or marked by bullets.

<p>An unordered list must begin with the <tag/UL/ tag which is immediately
followed by a <tag/LI/ (list item) tag:

<listing><![CDATA[
<UL>
<LI>First list item
<LI>Second list item
<LI>Third list item
</UL>
]]></listing>
