<h2>List Elements

<p>HTML includes a number of list elements. They may be used in
combination; for example, a <tag/OL/ may be nested in an <tag/LI/
element of a <tag/UL/.

<h3>Unordered List: <tag/UL/, <tag/LI/

<p>The <tag/UL/ represents a list of items with no inherent ordering
-- typically a bulleted list.

<p>The content of a <tag/UL/ element is a sequence of <tag/LI/
elements. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<UL>
<LI>First list item
<LI>Second list item
 <p>second paragraph of second item
<LI>Third list item
</UL>
]]></listing>

<h3>Ordered List: <tag/OL/

<p>The <tag/UL/ element represents an ordered list of items, sorted by
sequence or order of importance.

<p>The content of a <tag/OL/ element is a sequence of <tag/LI/
elements. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<OL>
<LI>Click the Web button to open the Open the URI window.
<LI>Enter the URI number in the text field of the Open URI 
window. The Web document you specified is displayed.
  <ol>
   <li>substep 1
   <li>substep 2
  </ol>
<LI>Click highlighted text to move from one link to another.
</OL>
]]></listing>

<p>The <attr/COMPACT/ attribute suggests that a compact rendering be
used.

<h3>Directory List: <tag/DIR/

<p>The <tag/DIR/ element is similar to the <tag/UL/ element.  It
represents a list of short items, typically up to 20 characters
each. Items in a directory list may be arranged in columns, typically
24 characters wide.

<p>The content of a <tag/OL/ element is a sequence of <tag/LI/
elements. Nested block elements are not allowed in the content of
<tag/DIR/ elements. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<DIR>
<LI>A-H<LI>I-M
<LI>M-R<LI>S-Z
</DIR>
]]></listing>

<h3>Menu List: <tag/MENU/

<p>The <tag/MENU/ element is a list of items with typically one line
per item. The menu list style is typically more compact than the style
of an unordered list.

<p>The content of a <tag/MENU/ element is a sequence of <tag/LI/
elements. Nested block elements are not allowed in the content of
<tag/MENU/ elements. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<MENU>
<LI>First item in the list.
<LI>Second item in the list.
<LI>Third item in the list.
</MENU>
]]></listing>

<h3>Definition List: <tag/DL/, <tag/DT/, <tag/DD/

<p>A definition list is a list of terms and corresponding
definitions. Definition lists are typically formatted with the term
flush-left and the definition, formatted paragraph style, indented
after the term.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<DL>
<DT>Term<DD>This is the definition of the first term.
<DT>Term<DD>This is the definition of the second term.
</DL>
]]></listing>

<p>If the DT term does not fit in the DT column (one third of the
display area), it may be extended across the page with the DD section
moved to the next line, or it may be wrapped onto successive lines of
the left hand column.

<p>The optional <attr/COMPACT/ attribute suggests that a compact
rendering be used, because the list items are small and/or the entire
list is large.

<p>Unless the <attr/COMPACT/ attribute is present, an HTML user agent
may leave white space between successive DT, DD pairs. The
<attr/COMPACT/ attribute may also reduce the width of the left-hand
(DT) column.

<listing><![CDATA[
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Term<DD>This is the first definition in compact format.
<DT>Term<DD>This is the second definition in compact format.
</DL>
]]></listing>
