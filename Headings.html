<NEXTID N="z36">
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><A
NAME="15">Headings</A></H1>Six levels  of heading are supported.
(Note that a hypertext node within
a hypertext work tends to need less
levels of  heading than a work whose
only structure is given by the nesting
of headings.)<P>
A heading element implies all the
font changes, paragraph breaks before
and after, and white space (for example)
necessary to render the heading.
Further character emphasis or paragraph
marks are not required in HTML.<P>
H1 is the highest level of heading,
and is recommended for the start
of a hypertext node.   It is suggested
that the the text of  the first heading
be suitable for a reader who is already
browsing in related information,
in contrast to the <A
NAME="6" HREF="Elements/TITLE.html">title</A> tag which
should identify the node in a wider
context.<P>
The heading elements are
<PRE>		&lt;H1>, &lt;H2>, &lt;H3>, &lt;H4>, &lt;H5>, &lt;H6>

</PRE>It is not normal practice to jump
from one header to a header level
more than one below, for example
for follow an H1 with an H3.  Although
this is legal, it is discouraged,
as it may produce strange results
for example when generating other
representations from the HTML.
<H2>Example:</H2>
<PRE>		&lt;H1>This is a heading&lt;/H1>
		Here is some text
		&lt;H2>Second level heading&lt;/H2>
		Here is some more text.

</PRE>
<H2>Parser Note:</H2>Parsers should not require any specific
order to heading elements, even if
the heading level increases by more
than one between successive headings.
<H2>Typical Rendering</H2>
<DL>
<DT>H1
<DD> Bold very large font, centered.
One or two lines clear space between
this and anything following.  If
printed on paper, start new page.
<DT>H2
<DD> Bold, large font,, flush left
against left margin, no indent. One
or two clear lines above and below.
<DT>H3
<DD> Italic, large font, slightly indented
from the left margin. One or two
clear lines above and below.
<DT>H4
<DD> Bold, normal font, indented more
than H3. One clear line above and
below.
<DT>H5
<DD> Italic, normal font, indented
as H4.  One clear line above.
<DT>H6
<DD> Bold, indented same as normal
text, more than H5. One clear line
above.
</DL>
These typical values are just an
indication, and it is up to the designer
of the presentation software to define
the styles.  The reader may have
options to customize these.  When
writing documents, you should assume
that whatever is done it is designed
to have the same sort of effect as
the styles above.<P>
The rendering software is responsible
for generating suitable vertical
white space between elements, so
it is NOT normal or required to follow
a heading element with a paragraph
mark.</A></BODY>
