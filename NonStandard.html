<H1>Obsolete elements</H1>

<P>The following <A HREF="Tags.html" NAME="z57">elements of HTML</A>
are obsolete. It is recommended that client implementors implement
the obsolete forms for compatibility with old servers.

<H3><A NAME="PLAINTEXT.index">Plaintext</A></H3>

<P>Status: <A HREF="StatusMeanings.html#z8"
NAME="z59">Obsolete</A> .

<P>The empty PLAINTEXT tag terminates the HTML entity.
What follows is not SGML. In stead, there's an old HTTP convention
that what follows is an ASCII (MIME "text/plain") body.

<P>An example if its use is:

<PRE>			<A HREF="HTML.dtd.html#z35" NAME="z53">&#60;PLAINTEXT&#62;</A>
			0001 This is line one of a ling listing
			0002 file from &#60;any@host.inc.com&#62; which is sent

</PRE>

<P>This tag allows the rest of a file to be read efficiently
without parsing. Its presence is an optimization.
There is no closing tag. The rest of the data is not in SGML.

<H3><A NAME="XMP.index">XMP</A> and <A
NAME="LISTING.index">LISTING</A>: <A NAME="z8">Example sections</A></H3>

<P>Status: <A HREF="StatusMeanings.html#z8"
NAME="z60">Obsolete</A> . This are in use and should be recognized
by browsers. New servers should use <A
HREF="#z31" NAME="z35">&#60;PRE&#62;</A> instead.

<P>These styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded
absolutely as is into the document. The syntax is:

<PRE>			&#60;LISTING&#62;
				...
			&#60;/LISTING&#62;

</PRE>

<P>or

<PRE>			&#60;XMP&#62;
				...
			&#60;/XMP&#62;

</PRE>

<P>The text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed
width font, so that any formatting done by character spacing
on successive lines will be maintained. Between the opening and
closing tags:

<UL>

<LI>The text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters,
but not the end tag opener. (See <A
HREF="LiteralHistory.html" NAME="z50">Historical note</A> )

<LI>Line boundaries are significant, except any occurring immediately
after the opening tag or before the closing tag.
and are to be rendered as a move to the start of a new line.

<LI>The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character must be interpreted
as the smallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will
leave the number of characters so far on the line as a multiple
of 8. Its use is not recommended however.
</UL>

<P>The <A NAME="z51">LISTING</A> element is portrayed so that
at least 132 characters will fit on a line.
The <A NAME="z22">XMP </A>
elementis portrayed in a font so that at least 80 characters
will fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING.

<H3>Highlighted Phrase HP1 etc</H3>

<P>Status: <A HREF="StatusMeanings.html#z4"
NAME="z52">Obsolete</A> . These tags like all others should be
ignored if not implemented. Replaced will more meaningful elements
-- see <A HREF="Highlighting.html" NAME="z39">character highlighting</A>
.

<H4>Examples of use:</H4>

<PRE>		&#60;HP1&#62;...&#60;/HP1&#62;   &#60;HP2&#62;... &#60;/HP2&#62; etc.

</PRE>

<H3>Comment element</H3>

<P>Status: <A HREF="StatusMeanings.html#z8"
NAME="z58">Obsolete</A>

<P>A comment element used for bracketing off unneed text and
comment has been introduced in some browsers but will be replaced
by the SGML command feature in new implementations.
