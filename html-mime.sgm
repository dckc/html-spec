<h1>HTML as an Internet Media Type

<h2>text/html media type

<p>This specification defines the Internet  Media Type\x11[7] (formerly referred to as the MIME 
Content Type\x11[4]) called  "text/html". The following is to be registered with IANA\x11[8].

Media Type name:		text

Media subtype name:		html

Required parameters:		none

Optional parameters:		level, version, charset

Encoding considerations:		any encoding is allowed

Security considerations:		[Section 14]



<p>The optional parameters are defined as follows:

tag/Level

/The level parameter specifies the feature set used in the document. The level is an integer 
number, implying that any features of same or lower level may be present in the document. 
Levels 0, 1 and 2 are defined by this specification. Level 2 is the default.

tag/Version

/To help avoid future compatibility problems, the version parameter may be used to give 
the version number of the specification to which the document conforms. The version 
number appears at the front of this document and within the public identifier of the HTML 
DTD. This specification defines version 2.0.

tag/Charset

/The charset parameter (as defined in section 7.1.1 of RFC 1521\x11[4]) may be given to 
specify the encoding used to represent the HTML document as a sequence of octets.

<h2>Character Set Issues

<p>An HTML interpreter must accept a stream of characters as input, and assign them to 
character classes used for markup recognition purposes. HTML 2.0 markup requires only the 
characters found in the US-ASCII character set\x11[10]. All US-ASCII characters with no markup 
role, and all non-US-ASCII characters, should be treated as data. Such categorization should 
take place after decoding the data stream (i.e., not at the characer set encoding level, but rather 
at the character set level).

<p>Normally, text/* media types specify a default value of US-ASCII for the charset 
parameter. However, for text/html, if the byte stream contains data that is not in the 7-bit US-
ASCII set, the interpreter should assume a default charset of ISO-8859-1. Even if an HTML 
document is limited to a US-ASCII encoding, the mechanisms of character entity references 
(Section 6.3) can be used to encode the characters from ISO-8859-1.

<p>Other values for the charset parameter may be defined by the transport mechanism (e.g., 
MIME and HTTP), but are not defined by this specification. Since the SGML declaration for 
HTML (supplied in Section 12.3) is only applicable to ISO-8859-1 and its subsets, a charset 
parameter that specifies a different character set must also imply a different SGML declaration. 
Therefore, user agents may use the charset parameter value to select a different declaration, 
even though the mechanism for doing so is not defined by this specification. The intent, 
however, is that such a declaration be as identical as possible to that of Section 12.3, the only 
differences being those required to support the announced charset.

<p>When the above conflicts with the SGML standard, the SGML standard may be ignored. 
Note, however, that not all HTML applications are capable of ignoring the SGML standard.

<h2>Undefined Tag and Attribute Names

<p>An accepted networking principle is to be conservative in what one produces, and liberal 
in what one accepts. HTML user agents should be liberal except when validating code; user 
agents are encouraged to provide an option for validation of what they render, such that users 
may be notified of an invalid construct when such notification is desirable. HTML generators 
should generate strictly conforming HTML. 

<p>HTML user agents reading "text/html" documents and discovering tag or attribute names 
which they do not understand should behave as though the offending tags or attribute names do 
not exist. Any unknown start tag (including its entire attribute specification list) or end tag 
should be ignored; any content between matching unknown start and end tags should be treated 
as normal (i.e., as if those tags did not occur in the character stream). The entire attribute 
specification of an unknown attribute (i.e., the unknown attribute and its value, if any) should 
be ignored.
