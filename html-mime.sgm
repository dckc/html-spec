<h1>HTML as an Internet Media Type

An HTML user agent allows users to interact with resources which have
HTML representations. At a minimum, it must allow users to examine and
navigate the content of HTML <![%level[ Level 0 ]]> documents.  HTML
user agents should be able to preserve all formatting distinctions
represented in an HTML document, and be able to simultaneously present
resources referred to by IMG elements. (they may ignore some
formatting distinctions or IMG resources at the request of the
user). Conforming HTML user agents <![%level[ that is Level 2 HTML
user agents, must ]]> should support form entry and submission.

<h2>text/html media type

<p>This specification defines the Internet Media Type[IMEDIA] (formerly
referred to as the Content Type[MIME]) called <code>text/html</>. The
following is to be registered with [IANA].

<tl>
<tli>Media Type name: text

<tli>Media subtype name: html

<tli>Required parameters: none

<tli>Optional parameters: <![%level[level, ]]>version, charset

<tli>Encoding considerations: any encoding is allowed

<tli> Security considerations: see <hdref refid=security>
</tl>


<p>The optional parameters are defined as follows:

<tl>
<![%level[
<tli>Level: The level parameter specifies the feature set used in the
document. The level is an integer number, implying that any features
of same or lower level may be present in the document.  Levels 0, 1
and 2 are defined by this specification. Level 2 is the default.

]]>
<tli>Version: To help avoid future compatibility problems, the version
parameter may be used to give the version number of the specification
to which the document conforms. The version number appears at the
front of this document and within the public identifier of the HTML
DTD. This specification defines version 2.0.

<tli>Charset: The charset parameter (as defined in section 7.1.1 of
RFC 1521[MIME]) may be given to specify the character encoding scheme
used to represent the HTML document as a sequence of octets.
</tl>

<h2>HTML Document Representation

A message entity with a content type of <code>text/html</> represents
an HTML document, consisting of a single text entity. The
<code>charset</> parameter (whether implicit or explicit) identifies a
character encoding scheme. The text entity consists of the characters
determined by this character encoding and the octets of the body of
the message entity.

HTML user agents must support the ISO-8859-1 character encoding
scheme, and hence the US-ASCII character encoding scheme.
<note>HTML user agents are encouraged to support ISO10646 as a
document character set, and Unicode-1-1-UTF-8 and Unicode-1-1-UCS-2 as
character encoding schemes. Other encodings schemes such as
ISO-2022-JP may be supported as well.</note>

<h3 id=conv1>Undeclared Markup Error Handling

To facilitate experimentation and interoperability between
implementations of various versions of HTML, the installed base of
HTML user agents supports a superset of the HTML 2.0 language by
reducing it to HTML 2.0: markup in the form of a start tag or end
tag whose generic identifier is not declared is mapped to nothing
during tokenization. Undeclared attributes are treated similarly.
The entire attribute specification of an unknown attribute (i.e.,
the unknown attribute and its value, if any) should be ignored.  On
the other hand, references to undeclared entities should be treated
as data characters.

For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
     <div class=chapter><h1>foo</h1><p>...</div>
	  => <H1>,"foo",</H1>,<P>,"..."

     xxx <P ID=z23> yyy
          => "xxx ",<P>," yyy

     Let &alpha; and &beta; be finite sets.
	  => "Let &alpha; and &beta; be finite sets."
]]></listing>

Support for notifying the user of such errors is encouraged.

Information providers should keep in mind that this convention is
not binding: unspecified behavior may result, as such markup is
not conforming to this specification.


<h3>Conventional Representation of Newlines

SGML specifies that a text entity is a sequence of records, each
beginning with a record start character and ending with a record end
character (characters numbered 10 and 13 respectively). (@@cite a
section)

MIME specifies that a body of type <code>text/*</> is a sequence of
lines, each terminated by CRLF, that is octets 10, 13.

In practice, HTML documents are frequently represented and
transmitted using an end of line convention that depends on the
conventions of the source of the document; frequently, that
representation consists of CR only, LF only, or CR LF
combination. Hence the decoding of the octets will often result in
a text entity with some missing record start and record end
characters.

Since there is no ambiguity, HTML user agents are encouraged to
infer the missing record start and end characters.

An HTML user agent should treat end of line in any of its
variations as a word space in all contexts except
preformatted text. Within preformatted text, an HTML user agent
should expect to treat any of the three common representations of
end-of-line as starting a new line.

<h2 id=security>Security Considerations

Anchors, embedded images, and all other elements which contain
URIs as parameters may  cause the URI to be dereferenced in response
to user input. In this case, the security  considerations of the URI
specification apply.
  
Documents may be constructed whose visible contents mislead the
reader to follow a link  to unsuitable or offensive material.
