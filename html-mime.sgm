<h1>HTML as an Internet Media Type

An HTML user agent allows users to interact with resources which have
HTML representations. At a minimum, it must allow users to examine and
navigate the content of HTML level 1 documents.  HTML user agents
should be able to preserve all formatting distinctions represented in
an HTML document, and be able to simultaneously present resources
referred to by IMG elements (they may ignore some formatting
distinctions or IMG resources at the request of the user). Level 2
HTML user agents should support form entry and submission.

<h2>text/html media type

<p>This specification defines the Internet Media Type[IMEDIA] (formerly
referred to as the Content Type[MIME]) called <code>text/html</>. The
following is to be registered with [IANA].

<tl>
<tli>Media Type name: text

<tli>Media subtype name: html

<tli>Required parameters: none

<tli>Optional parameters: level, charset

<tli>Encoding considerations: any encoding is allowed

<tli> Security considerations: see <hdref refid=security>
</tl>


<p>The optional parameters are defined as follows:

<tl>
<tli>Level: The level parameter specifies the feature set used in the
document. The level is an integer number, implying that any features
of same or lower level may be present in the document.  Level 1 is all
features defined in this specification except those that require the
<tag/FORM/ element. Level 2 includes form processing.  Level 2 is the
default.

<tli>Charset: The charset parameter (as defined in section 7.1.1 of
RFC 1521[MIME]) may be given to specify the character encoding scheme
used to represent the HTML document as a sequence of octets. The
default value is outside the scope of this specification; but for
example, the default is <code/US-ASCII/ in the context of MIME mail,
and <code/ISO-8859-1/ in the context of HTTP [HTTP].

</tl>

<h2>HTML Document Representation

A message entity with a content type of <code>text/html</> represents
an HTML document, consisting of a single text entity. The
<code>charset</> parameter (whether implicit or explicit) identifies a
character encoding scheme. The text entity consists of the characters
determined by this character encoding scheme and the octets of the body of
the message entity.

<h3 id=conv1>Undeclared Markup Error Handling

To facilitate experimentation and interoperability between
implementations of various versions of HTML, the installed base of
HTML user agents supports a superset of the HTML 2.0 language by
reducing it to HTML 2.0: markup in the form of a start-tag or end-tag,
whose generic identifier is not declared is mapped to nothing during
tokenization. Undeclared attributes are treated similarly.  The entire
attribute specification of an unknown attribute (i.e., the unknown
attribute and its value, if any) should be ignored.  On the other
hand, references to undeclared entities should be treated as data
characters.

For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<div class=chapter><h1>foo</h1><p>...</div>
  => <H1>,"foo",</H1>,<P>,"..."


xxx <P ID=z23> yyy
  => "xxx ",<P>," yyy


Let &alpha; &amp; &beta; be finite sets.
  => "Let &alpha; & &beta; be finite sets."
]]></listing>

Support for notifying the user of such errors is encouraged.

Information providers are warned that this convention is not binding:
unspecified behavior may result, as such markup does not conform to
this specification.


<h3>Conventional Representation of Newlines

SGML specifies that a text entity is a sequence of records, each
beginning with a record start character and ending with a record end
character (code positions 10 and 13 respectively) (section
7.6.1, "Record Boundaries" in [SGML]).

[MIME] specifies that a body of type <code>text/*</> is a sequence of
lines, each terminated by CRLF, that is, octets 13, 10.

In practice, HTML documents are frequently represented and
transmitted using an end of line convention that depends on the
conventions of the source of the document; frequently, that
representation consists of CR only, LF only, or a CR LF
sequence. Hence the decoding of the octets will often result in
a text entity with some missing record start and record end
characters.

Since there is no ambiguity, HTML user agents are encouraged to
infer the missing record start and end characters.

An HTML user agent should treat end of line in any of its
variations as a word space in all contexts except
preformatted text. Within preformatted text, an HTML user agent
should treat any of the three common representations of
end-of-line as starting a new line.
