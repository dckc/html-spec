<h2>Terminology

<p>The HTML specification uses these words with precise meanings:

<tl>
<tli>attribute:

A syntactical component of an HTML element which is often used to
specify a characteristic quality of an element, other than type or
content.

<tli>document type definition (DTD):

A DTD is a collection of declarations (entity, element, attribute,
link, map, etc.) in SGML syntax that defines the components and
structures available for a class (type) of documents.

<tli>element:

A component of the hierarchical structure defined by the document type
definition; it is identified in a document instance by descriptive
markup, usually a start-tag and an end-tag.

<tli>HTML document:

A collection of information represented as a sequence of
characters. An HTML document consists of data characters and
markup. In particular, the markup describes a structure conforming to
the HTML document type definition.

<tli>HTTP:

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol\x11[3] is the primary
application-level protocol for the transfer of documents via the
World-Wide Web.

<tli>interpreter:

A tool or algorithm used to parse and/or render an HTML document.

<tli>(document) instance:

The document itself including the actual content with the actual
markup. Can be a single document or part of a document instance set
that follows the DTD.

<tli>markup:

Text added to the data of a document to convey information about
it. There are four different kinds of markup: descriptive markup
(tags), references, markup declarations, and processing instructions.

<tli>MIME:

The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\x11[4] provide the ability
to transfer non-textual data, such as graphics, audio and fax, via
Internet mail.

<tli>representation:

The encoding of information for interchange. For example, HTML is a
representation of hypertext.

<tli>rendering:

Formatting and presenting information.

<tli>SGML:

Standard Generalized Markup Language\x11[12] (see also\x11[9]
and[6]) is a programming language for describing the allowed
markup constructs and syntax for textual document types.

<tli>tag:

Descriptive markup. There are two kinds of tags; start-tags and
end-tags. All HTML tags start with the less than character ("<") and
end with a greater than (">").

<tli>URI:

A Universal Resource Identifier\x11[1] is a formatted string that
serves as an identifier for a resource on the Internet. URIs are used
by HTML to identify the destination of hypertext links, the source of
in-line images, and the object of form actions. URIs in common use
include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)\x11[2] and Relative
URLs\x11[5].

<tli>WWW:

The World-Wide Web is a hypertext-based, distributed information
system created by researchers at CERN in Switzerland. Users may
create, edit or browse hypertext
documents. <code>http://www.w3.org/</>

<h2>Imperatives

<p>@@

<tl>
<tli>may:

The implementation is not obliged to follow this in any way.

<tli>must:

If this is not followed, the implementation does not conform to this
specification.

<tli>shall:

If this is not followed, the implementation does not conform to this
specification.

<tli>should:

If this is not followed, though the implementation officially conforms
to the specification, undesirable results may occur in practice.

<tli>typical:

Typical rendering is described for many elements. This is not a
mandatory part of the specification but is given as guidance for
designers and to help explain the uses for which the elements were
intended.
