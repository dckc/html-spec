<h2 id=headings>Headings: H1 ... H6

<p>The six heading elements, <tag/H1/ through <tag/H6/, denote section
headings. Although the order and occurence of headings is not
constrained by the HTML DTD, documents should not skip levels (for
example, from H1 to H3), as converting such documents to other
representations is often problematic.


<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<H1>This is a heading</H1>
Here is some text
<H2>Second level heading</H2>
Here is some more text.
]]></listing>

<p>Typical renderings are:

<tl>
<tli>H1: Bold, very-large font, centered. One or two blank lines
above and below.

<tli>H2: Bold, large font, flush-left. One or two blank lines
above and below.

<tli>H3: Italic, large font, slightly indented from the left
margin. One or two blank lines above and below.

<tli>H4: Bold, normal font, indented more than H3. One blank
line above and below.

<tli>H5: Italic, normal font, indented as H4. One blank line
above.

<tli>H6: Bold, indented same as normal text, more than H5. One
blank line above.
