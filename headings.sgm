<h2>Headings

<![CDATA[
<H1> ... </H1> through <H6> ... </H6>	Level 0
]]>

<p>HTML defines six levels of heading. A Heading element implies all
the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and white space
necessary to render the heading.

<p>The highest level of headings is H1, followed by H2 ... H6.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<H1>This is a heading</H1>
Here is some text
<H2>Second level heading</H2>
Here is some more text.
]]></listing>

<p>The rendering of headings is determined by the HTML interpreter,
but typical renderings are:

<tl>
<tli>&lt;H1> ... &lt;/H1>:

Bold, very-large font, centered. One or two blank lines above and
below.

<tli>&lt;H2> ... &lt;/H2>:

Bold, large font, flush-left. One or two blank lines above and below.

<tli>&lt;H3> ... &lt;/H3>:

Italic, large font, slightly indented from the left margin. One or two
blank lines above and below.

<tli>&lt;H4> ... &lt;/H4>:

Bold, normal font, indented more than H3. One blank line above and
below.

<tli>&lt;H5> ... &lt;/H5>:

Italic, normal font, indented as H4. One blank line above.

<tli>&lt;H6> ... &lt;/H6>:

Bold, indented same as normal text, more than H5. One blank line
above.
</tl>

<p>Although heading levels can be skipped (for example, from H1 to
H3), this practice is discouraged as skipping heading levels may
produce unpredictable results when generating other representations
from HTML.
