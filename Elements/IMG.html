The IMG element allows another document
to be inserted inline.  The document
is normally an icon or small graphic,
etc. This element is NOT intended
for embedding other HTML text.<P>
Browsers which are not able to display
inline images ignore IMG elements.
Authors should note that some browsers
will be able to display (or print)
linked graphics but not inline graphics.
If the graphic is essential, it may
be wiser to make a link to it rather
than to put it inline.  If the graphic
is essentially decorative, then IMG
is appropriate.<P>
The IMG element is empty: it has
no closing tag. It has two attributes:
<DL>
<DT>SRC
<DD> The value of this attribute is
the URL of the document to be embedded.
Its syntax is the same as that of
the <A
NAME="z1" HREF="A.html#13">HREF attribute</A> of the A tag.
SRC is mandatory.
<DT>ALIGN
<DD> Take values TOP or MIDDLE or
BOTTOM, defining whether the tops
or middles of bottoms of the graphics
and text should be aligned vertically.
<DT>ALT
<DD> Optional alternative text as
an alternative to the graphics for
display in text-only environments.
</DL>
Note that IMG elements are allowed
within anchors.
