<H1>Note: METHODS attribute of Links</H1>

<P>The METHODS attributes of anchors and links are used to provide
information about the functions which the user may perform on
an object. These are more accurately given by the HTTP protocol
when it is used, but it may, for similar reasons as for the TITLE
attribute, be useful to include the information in advance in
the link.

<P>For example, The browser may chose a different rendering as
a function of the methods allowed (for example something which
is searchable may get a different icon)
