<BODY>

<H1>LINK</H1>

<P>The LINK element occurs within the HEAD element of an <A
HREF="../MarkUp.html" NAME="z2">HTML</A> document.
It is used to indicate a relationship between the document and
some other object. A document may have any number of LINK elements.

<P>The LINK element is empty, but takes the same attributes as
the <A HREF="A.html" NAME="z1">anchor element</A> .

<P>Typical uses are to indicate authorship,
related indexes and glossaries, older or more recent versions,
etc. Links can indicate a static tree structure in which the
document was authored by pointing to a "parent" and "next" and
"previous" document, for example.

<P>Servers may also allow links to be added by those who do not
have the right to alter the body of a document.
