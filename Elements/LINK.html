<H1>LINK</H1>The LINK element occurs within the
HEAD element of an <A
NAME=z2 HREF="../MarkUp.html">HTML</A> document.
It is used to indicate a relationship
between the document and some other
object.  A document may have any
number of LINK elements. <P>
The LINK element is empty, but takes
the same attributes as the <A
NAME=z1 HREF="A.html">anchor
element</A> .<P>
Typical  uses are to indicate authorship,
related indexes and glossaries, older
or more recent versions, etc.  Links
can indicate a static tree structure
in which the document was authored
by pointing to a "parent" and "next"
and "previous" document, for example.<P>
Servers may also allow links to be
added by those who do not have the
right to alter the body of a document.</A></BODY>
