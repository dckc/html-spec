<H1>FORM</H1>

<P>The FORM element is used to delimit the <A
NAME="z1" HREF="../Forms.html">form</A> .
There can be several forms in a single document,
but the FORM element can't be nested.

<P>The ACTION attribute specifies a URL that designates an HTTP
server or an email address. If missing, the URL for the document
itself will be assumed. The effect of the action can be modified
by including a method prefix, e.g. ACTION="POST http://...."
. This prefix is used to select the HTTP method when sending
the form's contents to an HTTP server. [[Would it be cleaner
to use a separate attribute, e.g. METHOD ?]
