<BODY>
<H1>PRE: <A
NAME="z24">Preformatted text</A></H1><P>Preformatted elements in <A
NAME="z31" HREF="../MarkUp.html">HTML</A> are
displayed with text in a fixed width
font, and so are suitable for text
which has been formatted for a teletype
by some existing formatting system.
<PRE>

</PRE><P>The optional attribute is:
<DL>
<DT>WIDTH 
<DD>This attribute gives the maximum
number of characters which will occur
on a line.  It allows the presentation
system to select a suitable font
and indentation. Where the WIDTH
attribute is not recognized, it is
recommended that a width of 80 be
assumed. Where WIDTH is supported,
it is recommended that at least widths
of 40, 80 and 132 characters be presented
optimally, with other widths being
rounded up.
</DL>
<P>Within a PRE element,
<UL>
<LI>Line boundaries within the text are
rendered as a move to the beginning
of the next line, except for one
immediately following or immediately
preceding a tag.
<LI> The &lt;p> tag should not be used.
If found, it should be rendered as
a move to the beginning of the next
line.
<LI>Anchor elements and character highlighting
elements may be used.
<LI>Elements which define paragraph formatting
(Headings, Address, etc) must not
be used.
<LI>The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character
must be interpreted as the smallest
positive nonzero number of spaces
which will leave the number of characters
so far on the line as a multiple
of 8. Its use is not recommended
however.
</UL>
<H3>Example of use</H3>
<PRE>			<A
NAME="z33" HREF="../HTML.dtd.html#z34">&lt;PRE</A> WIDTH="80">
			This is an example line
			&lt;/PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Note: Highlighting</H3><P>Within a preformatted element,  the
constraint that the rendering must
be on a fixed horizontal character
pitch may limit or prevent the ability
of the renderer to render highlighting
elements specially.
<H3>Note: Margins </H3><P>The above references to the "beginning
of a new line" must not be taken
as implying that the renderer is
forbidden from using a (constant)
left indent for rendering preformatted
text.   The left indent may of course
be constrained by the width required.</BODY>
