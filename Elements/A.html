<H1><A
NAME="4">Anchors</A></H1>An anchor is a piece of text which
marks the beginning and/or the end
of a hypertext link.   <P>
The text between the opening tag
and the closing tag is either the
start or destination (or both) of
a link. Attributes of the anchor
tag are as follows.
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME="13">HREF</A>
<DD> OPTIONAL. If the HREF attribute
is present, the anchor is sensitive
text: the start of a link. If the
reader selects this text,  (s)he
should be presented with another
document whose network address is
defined by the value of the HREF
attribute . The format of the network
address is specified <A
NAME="10" HREF="../../Addressing/Addressing.html">elsewhere</A> .
This allows for the form HREF="#identifier"
to refer to another anchor in the
same document. If the anchor is in
another document, the attribute is
a <A
NAME="14" HREF="../../Addressing/Relative.html">relative name</A> , relative to the
documents address (or specified <A
NAME="12" HREF="#11">base
address</A> if any).
<DT>NAME
<DD> OPTIONAL. If present, the  attribute
NAME allows the anchor to be the
destination of a link. The value
of the attribute is an identifier
for the anchor.  Identifiers are
arbitrary strings  but must be unique
within the HTML document.   Another
document can then make a reference
explicitly to this anchor by putting
the identifier after the address,
separated by a <A
NAME="19" HREF="../../Addressing/BNF.html#21">hash sign</A> .
<DT><A
NAME="21">REL</A>
<DD> OPTIONAL. An attribute REL may
give the relationship (s) described
by the hypertext link. The value
is a comma-separated list of relationship
values.   Values and their semantics
will be registered by the HTML <A
NAME="z41" HREF="../RegistrationAuthority.html">registration
authority</A> . The default relationship
if none other is given is void. REL
should not be present unless HREF
is present. See <A
NAME="z37" HREF="../Relationships.html">Relationship values</A>
, <A
NAME="z40" HREF="#z39">REV</A> .
<DT><A
NAME="z39">REV</A>
<DD> OPTIONAL. The same as <A
NAME="z38" HREF="#21">REL</A> , but
the semantics of the link type are
in the reverse direction.  A link
from A to B with REL="X" expresses
the same relationship as a link from
B to A with REV="X".   An anchor
may have both REL and REV attributes.
<DT><A
NAME="z30">URN</A>
<DD> OPTIONAL. If present, this specifies
a uniform resource number for the
document. See <A
NAME="z29" HREF="../URN.html">note</A> .
<DT><A
NAME="z32">TITLE</A>
<DD> OPTIONAL. This is informational
only. If present the value of this
field should equal the value of the
TITLE of the document whose address
is given by the HREF attribute. See<A
NAME="z31" HREF="LinkTitle.html">
note</A> . 
<DT>METHODS
<DD> OPTIONAL. The value of this
field is a string which if present
must be a comma separated list of
HTTP METHODS supported by the object
for public use.  See <A
NAME="z33" HREF="LinkMethods.html">note</A> .
</DL>
All attributes are optional, although
one of NAME and HREF is necessary
for the anchor to be useful. See
also: <A
NAME="z28" HREF="LINK.html">LINK</A> .
