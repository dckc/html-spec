<H1><A NAME="z4">Anchors</A></H1>

<P>An anchor is a piece of text which marks the beginning and/or
the end of a hypertext link.

<P>The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either
the start or destination (or both) of a link.
Attributes of the anchor tag are as follows.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z13">HREF</A>

<DD>OPTIONAL. If the HREF attribute is present,
the anchor is sensitive text: the start of a link.
If the reader selects this text, (s)he should be presented with
another document whose network address is defined by the value
of the HREF attribute . The format of the network address is
specified <A
HREF="../../Addressing/Addressing.html"
NAME="z10">elsewhere</A> . This allows for the form HREF="#identifier"
to refer to another anchor in the same document.
If the anchor is in another document, the attribute is a <A
HREF="../../Addressing/Relative.html" NAME="z14">relative name</A>
, relative to the documents address (or specified <A
HREF="#11" NAME="z12">base address</A> if any).
<DL>

<DT><STRONG>@@NOTE:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>This refers to the URI specification,
which does not cover relative addresses.
There is no specification of how to distinguish relative addresses
from absolute addresses. </EM>

</DL>


<DT>NAME

<DD>OPTIONAL. If present, the attribute NAME allows the anchor
to be the destination of a link. The value of the attribute is
an identifier for the anchor. Identifiers are arbitrary strings
but must be unique within the HTML document.
Another document can then make a reference explicitly to this
anchor by putting the identifier after the address,
separated by a <A
HREF="../../Addressing/BNF.html#21" NAME="z19">hash sign</A>
.
<DL>

<DT><STRONG>@@NOTE:</STRONG>

<DD><EM>This feature is representable in SGML as an ID attribute,
if we restrict the identifiers to be <A
HREF="../Text.html#name">SGML names</A>.
</EM>

</DL>


<DT><A NAME="z21">REL</A>

<DD>OPTIONAL. An attribute REL may give the relationship (s)
described by the hypertext link. The value is a comma-separated
list of relationship values. Values and their semantics will
be registered by the HTML <A
HREF="../RegistrationAuthority.html" NAME="z41">registration
authority</A> . The default relationship if none other is given
is void. REL should not be present unless HREF is present.
See <A HREF="../Relationships.html" NAME="z37">Relationship values</A>
, <A HREF="#z39" NAME="z40">REV</A> .

<DT><A NAME="z39">REV</A>

<DD>OPTIONAL. The same as <A HREF="#21"
NAME="z38">REL</A> , but the semantics of the link type are in
the reverse direction. A link from A to B with REL="X" expresses
the same relationship as a link from B to A with REV="X".
An anchor may have both REL and REV attributes.

<DT><A NAME="z30">URN</A>

<DD>OPTIONAL. If present, this specifies a uniform resource number
for the document. See <A HREF="../URN.html"
NAME="z29">note</A> .

<DT><A NAME="z32">TITLE</A>

<DD>OPTIONAL. This is informational only.
If present the value of this field should equal the value of
the TITLE of the document whose address is given by the HREF
attribute. See<A HREF="LinkTitle.html"
NAME="z31"> note</A> .

<DT>METHODS

<DD>OPTIONAL. The value of this field is a string which if present
must be a comma separated list of HTTP METHODS supported by the
object for public use. See <A
HREF="LinkMethods.html" NAME="z33">note</A> .
</DL>

<P>All attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF
is necessary for the anchor to be useful.
See also: <A HREF="LINK.html" NAME="z28">LINK</A> .
