<TITLE>The META element in HTML (proposed)</TITLE> <NEXTID
N="z3"></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>META (proposed)</H1>

<P>The META element can be used within the <A
NAME="z1" HREF="HEAD.html">HEAD</A> element to embed document
metainformation not defined by other HTML elements.
Such information can be extracted by servers/clients for use
in identifying, indexing, and cataloging specialized document
metainformation.

<P>Although it is generally preferable to use named elements
which have well-defined semantics for each type of metainformation
(e.g. <A NAME="z2" HREF="TITLE.html">TITLE</A>),
this element is provided for situations where strict SGML parsing
is necessary and the local DTD is not extensible.

<P>In addition, HTTP servers can read the content of the document
HEAD to generate response headers corresponding to any elements
defining a value for the attribute HTTP-EQUIV.
This provides document authors a mechanism (not necessarily the
preferred one) for identifying information which should be included
in the response headers for an HTTP request.

<P>The attributes of the META element are:

<DL>

<DT>HTTP-EQUIV

<DD>This attribute binds the element to an HTTP response header.
It means that if you know the semantics of the HTTP response
header named by this attribute, then you can process the contents
based on a well-defined syntactic mapping,
whether or not your DTD tells you anything about it.
HTTP header names are not case sensitive.
If not present, the attribute NAME should be used to identify
this metainformation and it should not be used within an HTTP
response header.

<DT>NAME

<DD>Metainformation name. If not present,
the name can be assumed equal to the value of HTTP-EQUIV.

<DT>CONTENT

<DD>The metainformation content to be associated with the given
name and/or HTTP response header.
</DL>

<H2>Examples of use</H2>

<P>If the document contains:

<PRE>
    &#60;expires http-equiv="Expires"&#62;Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT&#60;/expires&#62;
    &#60;meta http-equiv="Keywords" content="Fred, Barney, Wilma"&#62;
    &#60;meta http-equiv="Reply-to" content="fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)"&#62;
</PRE>
The server may include the headers:
<PRE>
    Expires: Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT
    Keywords: Fred, Barney, Wilma
    Reply-to: fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)
</PRE>
as part of the HTTP response to a GET or HEAD request for that
document.
<P>When the HTTP-EQUIV attribute is not present,
the server should not generate an HTTP response header for this
metainformation; e.g.,

<PRE>
    &#60;meta name="IndexType" content="Service"&#62;
</PRE>
would not generate an HTTP response header but would still allow
clients or other tools to make use of that metainformation.
<H2>Examples of misuse</H2>

<P>One example of an inappropriate usage for the META element
is to use it to define information that should be associated
with an already existing HTML element, e.g.

<PRE>
    &#60;meta name="Title" content="The Etymology of Dunsel"&#62;
</PRE>

<P>A second example of inappropriate usage is to name an HTTP-EQUIV
equal to a response header that should normally only be generated
by the HTTP server. Example names that are inappropriate include
"Server", "Date", and "Last-modified" -- the exact list of inappropriate
names is dependent on the particular server implementation.
It is recommended that servers ignore any META elements which
specify http-equivalents which are equal (case-insensitively)
to their own reserved response headers.
