<H1>BLOCKQUOTE</H1>

<P>The BLOCKQUOTE element allows text quoted from another source
to be rendered specially.

<H2>Typical rendering</H2>

<P>A typical rendering might be a slight extra left and right
indent, and/or italic font. BLOCKQUOTE causes a paragraph break,
and typically a line or so of white space will be allowed between
it and any text before or after it.

<P>Single-font rendition may for example put a vertical line
of "&#62;" characters down the left margin to indicate quotation
in the Internet mail style.

<H2>Example</H2>

<PRE>I think it ends
&#60;BLOCKQUOTE&#62;Soft you now, the fair Ophelia. Nymph, in thy orisons, 
be all my sins remembered.
&#60;/BLOCKQUOTE&#62;
but I am not sure.
</PRE>
