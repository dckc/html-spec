<H1>BLOCKQUOTE</H1><P>The BLOCKQUOTE element allows text
quoted from another source to be
rendered specially.
<H2>Typical rendering</H2><P>A typical rendering might be a slight
extra left and right indent, and/or
italic font.  BLOCKQUOTE causes a
paragraph break, and typically a
line or so of white space will be
allowed between it and any text before
or after it.<P>
Single-font rendition may for example
put a vertical line of ">" characters
down the left margin to indicate
quotation in the Internet mail style.
<H2>Example</H2>
<PRE>I think it ends
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE>Soft you now, the fair Ophelia. Nymph, in thy orisons, 
be all my sins remembered.
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE>
but I am not sure.
