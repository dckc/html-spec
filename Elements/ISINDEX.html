<H1><A NAME="z18">ISINDEX</A></H1>

<P>This element informs the reader that the document is an index
document. As well as reading it, the reader may use a keyword
search.

<P>The node may be queried with a keyword search by suffixing
the node address with a question mark, followed by a list of
keywords separated by plus signs. See the <A
HREF="../../Addressing/Search.html" NAME="z1">network address
format</A> .

<P>Note that this tag is normally generated automatically by
a server. If it is added by hand to an HTML document,
then the client will assume that the server can handle a search
on the document. Obviously the server must have this capability
for it to work: simply adding &#60;ISINDEX&#62; in the document
is not enough to make searches happen if the server does not
have a search engine!

<P>Status: standard.

<H2>Example of use:</H2>

<PRE>		&#60;ISINDEX&#62;
