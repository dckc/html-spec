<H1><A
NAME="z18">ISINDEX</A></H1><P>This element informs the reader that
the document is an index document.
As well as reading it, the reader
may use a keyword search.<P>
The node may be queried with a keyword
search by suffixing the node address
with a question mark, followed by
a list of keywords separated by plus
signs. See the <A
NAME="z1" HREF="../../Addressing/Search.html">network address format</A>
.<P>
Note that this tag is normally generated
automatically by a server.  If it
is added by hand to an HTML document,
then the client  will assume that
the server can handle a search on
the document.  Obviously the server
must have this capability for it
to work: simply adding &lt;ISINDEX>
in the document is not enough to
make searches happen if the server
does not have a search engine!<P>
Status: standard.
<H2>Example of use:</H2>
