<H1>P: Paragraph mark</H1>The empty P element indicates a paragraph
break. The exact rendering of this
(indentation,  leading, etc) is not
defined here, and may be a function
of other tags, style sheets etc.<P>
&lt;P> is used between two pieces of
text which otherwise would be flowed
together.<P>
You do NOT need to use &lt;P>  to put
white space around heading, list,
address or blockquote elements which
imply a paragraph break. It is the
responsibility of the rendering software
to generate that white space.   A
paragraph mark which is preceded
or followed by such elements which
imply a paragraph break is has undefined
effect and should be avoided.
<H2>Typical rendering</H2>Typically, &lt;P> will generate a small
vertical space (of a line or half
a line) between the paragraphs. This
is not the case (typically) within
ADDRESS  or (ever) within PRE elements.
 With some implementations, in normal
text, &lt;P> may generate a small extra
left indent on the first line.
<H2>Examples of use</H2>
<PRE>	&lt;h1>What to do&lt;/h1>
	This is a one paragraph.&lt;<A
NAME="z35" HREF="../HTML.dtd.html#z26"> p</A> >This is a second.
	&lt;<A
NAME="z34" HREF="../HTML.dtd.html#z26"> P</A> >
	This is a third.

</PRE>
<H2>Bad example</H2>
<PRE>        &lt;h1>&lt;P>What not to do&lt;/h1>
	&lt;p>I found that on my XYZ browser it looked prettier to
	me if I put some paragraph marks
	&lt;p>
	&lt;ul>&lt;p>&lt;li>Around lists, and
	&lt;li>After headings.
	&lt;/ul>
	&lt;p>
	None of the paragraph marks in this example should
	be there.
