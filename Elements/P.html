<BODY>

<H1>P: Paragraph mark</H1>

<P>The empty P element indicates a paragraph break.
The exact rendering of this (indentation,
leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a function of other
tags, style sheets etc.

<P>&#60;P&#62; is used between two pieces of text which otherwise
would be flowed together.

<P>You do NOT need to use &#60;P&#62; to put white space around
heading, list, address or blockquote elements which imply a paragraph
break. It is the responsibility of the rendering software to
generate that white space. A paragraph mark which is preceded
or followed by such elements which imply a paragraph break is
has undefined effect and should be avoided.

<H2>Typical rendering</H2>

<P>Typically, &#60;P&#62; will generate a small vertical space
(of a line or half a line) between the paragraphs.
This is not the case (typically) within ADDRESS or (ever) within
PRE elements. With some implementations,
in normal text, &#60;P&#62; may generate a small extra left indent
on the first line.

<H2>Examples of use</H2>

<PRE>	&#60;h1&#62;What to do&#60;/h1&#62;
	This is a one paragraph.&#60;<A
HREF="../HTML.dtd.html#z26" NAME="z35"> p</A> &#62;This is a second.
	&#60;<A
HREF="../HTML.dtd.html#z26" NAME="z34"> P</A> &#62;
	This is a third.

</PRE>

<H2>Bad example</H2>

<PRE>        &#60;h1&#62;&#60;P&#62;What not to do&#60;/h1&#62;
	&#60;p&#62;I found that on my XYZ browser it looked prettier to
	me if I put some paragraph marks
	&#60;p&#62;
	&#60;ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;li&#62;Around lists, and
	&#60;li&#62;After headings.
	&#60;/ul&#62;
	&#60;p&#62;
	None of the paragraph marks in this example should
	be there.
