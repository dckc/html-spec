<H1><A NAME="z2">TITLE</A></H1>

<P>The title of a document is specified by the TITLE element.
The TITLE element must occur in the <A
HREF="HEAD.html" NAME="z29">HEAD</A> of the document.

<P>There may only be one title in any document.
It should identify the content of the document in a fairly wide
context.

<P>It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks,
or highlighting. The title may be used to identify the node in
a history list, to label the window displaying the node,
etc. It is not normally displayed in the text of a document itself.
Contrast titles with <A HREF="#z15" NAME="z16">headings</A> .
The title should ideally be less than 64 characters in length.
That is, many applications will display document titles in window
titles, menus, etc where there is only limited room.
Whilst there is no limit on the length of a title (as it may
be automatically generated from other data),
information providers are warned that it may be truncated if
long.

<H3>Examples of use</H3>

<P>Appropriate titles might be

<PRE>		&#60;TITLE&#62;Rivest and Neuman. 1989(b)&#60;/TITLE&#62;
</PRE>

</PRE>

<PRE>		&#60;TITLE&#62;Introduction -- AFS user's Guide&#60;/TITLE&#62;

<P>Examples of inappropriate titles are those which are only
meaningful within context,
