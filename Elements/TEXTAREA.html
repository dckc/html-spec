<H1>TEXTAREA</H1>

<P>When you need to let users enter more than one line of text,
you should use the TEXTAREA element, e.g.

<PRE>&#60;TEXTAREA NAME="address" ROWS=64 COLS=6&#62;
Hewlett Packard Laboratories
1501 Page Mill Road
Palo Alto, California 94304-1126
&#60;/TEXTAREA&#62;

</PRE>

<P>The text up to the end tag is used to initialize the field's
value. This end tag is always required even if the field is initially
blank.

<H2>Typical rendering</H2>

<P>The ROWS and COLS attributes determine the visible dimension
of the field in characters. The field is rendered in a fixed-width
font. Browsers are recommended to allow text to grow beyond these
limits by scrolling as needed.

<H2>Explanatory Note: TEXTAREA and INPUT/TEXT</H2>

<P>In the initial design for forms, multi-line text fields were
supported by the INPUT element with TYPE=TEXT .
Unfortunately, this causes problems for fields with long text
values as SGML limits the length of attribute literals.
The HTML+ DTD allows for up to 1024 characters (the SGML default
is only 240 characters!).
