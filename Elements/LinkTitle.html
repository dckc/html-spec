<H1>Note: TITLE attribute of links</H1>

<P>The link may carry a <A NAME="z1"
HREF="A.html#z32">TITLE</A> attribute which should if present
give the title of the document whose address is given by the
HREF attribute.

<P>This is useful for at least two reasons

<UL>

<LI>The browser software may chose to display the title of the
document as a preliminary to retrieving it,
for example as a margin note or on a small box while the mouse
is over the anchor, or during document fetch.

<LI>Some documents -- mainly those which are not marked up text,
such as graphics, plain text and also Gopher menus,
do not come with a title themselves, and so putting a title in
the link is the only way to give them a title.
This is how Gopher works. Obviously it leads to duplication of
data, and so it is dangerous to assume that the title attribute
of the link is a valid and unique title for the destination document.
