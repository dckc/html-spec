input. This can be greater that specified by SIZE ,
in which case the field will scroll appropriately.

</DL>

<H2>Types</H2>

<P>The following types of fields can be defined with the TYPE
attribute :

<DL>

<DT>TEXT

<DD>Single line text entry fields. Use the SIZE attribute to
specify the visible width in characters,
e.g. SIZE="24" for a 24 character field.
The MAX attribute can be used to specify an upper limit to the
number of characters that can be entered into a text field,
e.g. MAX=72 . Use the TEXTAREA element for text fields which
can accept multiple lines (see below).

<DT>HIDDEN

<DD>No field is presented to the user, but the content of the
field is sent with the submitted form. This value may be used
to transmit state information about client/server interaction.

<DT><A NAME="z3">CHECKBOX</A>

<DD>Used for simple Boolean attributes, or for attributes which
can take multiple values at the same time.
The latter is represented by a number of checkbox fields each
of which has the same NAME .

<DT><A NAME="z2">RADIO</A>

<DD>For attributes which can take a single value from a set of
alternatives. Each radio button field in the group should be
given the same NAME .

<DT>SUBMIT

<DD>This is a button that when pressed submits the form.
It offers authors control over the location of this button.
You can use an image as a submit button by specifying a URL with
the SRC attribute.

<DT>RESET

<DD>This is a button that when pressed resets the form's fields
to their initial values as specified by the VALUE attribute.
You can use an image as a reeset button by specifying a URL with
the SRC attribute.
