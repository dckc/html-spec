<H1><A
NAME=z26>Next ID</A></H1>This tag takes a  single attribute
which is the number of the next document-wide
numeric identifier to be allocated
of the form z123. <P>
When modifying a document, old anchor
ids should not be reused, as there
may be references stored elsewhere
which point to them.  This is read
and generated by hypertext editors.
Human writers of HTML usually use
mnemonic alphabetical identifiers. Browser
software may ignore this tag.
