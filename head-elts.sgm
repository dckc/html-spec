<h3>Title: TITLE

<p>Every HTML document must contain a <tag/TITLE/ element.

<p> The title should identify the contents of the document in a global
context.  A short title, such as "Introduction" may be meaningless out
of context. A title such as "Introduction to HTML Elements" is more
appropriate.
<NOTE>The length of a title is not limited; however, long titles may
be truncated in some applications. To minimize this possibility,
titles should be fewer than 64 characters.</note>

<p> A user agent may display the title of a document in a history list
or as a label for the window displaying the document. Contrast with
headings (<hdref refid=headings>), which are typically displayed with
the body text flow.

<h3 id=base>Base URI: BASE

<p>The optional <tag/BASE/ element specifies the URI of the document,
overriding any context otherwise known to the user agent. The required
<attr/HREF/ attribute specifies the URI for navigating the document
(see <hdref refid=hyperlink>). The value of the <attr/HREF/ attribute
must be an absolute URI.

<h3>Keyword Index: ISINDEX

<p>The <tag/ISINDEX/ element indicates that the user agent should
allow the user to search an index by giving keywords. See <hdref
refid=query> for details.

<h3>Link: LINK

<p>The <tag/LINK/ element represents a hyperlink (see <hdref
refid=hyperlink>). It has the same attributes as the <tag/A/ element
(see <hdref refid=a>).

<p>The <tag/LINK/ element is typically used to indicate authorship,
related indexes and glossaries, older or more recent versions,
style sheets, document hierarchy etc.

<h3>Associated Meta-information: META

<p> The <tag/META/ element is an extensible container for use in
identifying, indexing, and cataloging specialized document
meta-information. Meta-information has two main functions:

<ul>
<li>to provide a means to discover that the data set exists and
how it might be obtained or accessed; and 

<li>to document the content, quality, and features of a data set
and so give an indication of its fitness for use. 
</ul>

<p> Each <tag/META/ element specifies a name/value pair.  If multiple
META elements are provided with the same name, their combined
contents--concatenated as a comma-separated list--is the value
associated with that name.
<note>The <tag/META/ element should not be used where a specific
element such as <tag/TITLE/ would be appropriate.
</note>

<p>HTTP servers should read the content of the document <tag/HEAD/ to
generate header fields corresponding to any elements defining a value
for the attribute <attr/HTTP-EQUIV/.
<note>The method by which the server extracts document meta-information is
unspecified and not mandatory. The META element
only provides an extensible mechanism for identifying and embedding
document meta-information - how it may be used is up to the individual
server implementation and the HTML user agent.
</note>

<p>Attributes of the META element:

<tl>
<tli>HTTP-EQUIV: This attribute binds the element to an HTTP header
field. An HTTP server may use this information to process the
document. In particular, it should include a header field in the
responses to <attr/GET/ requests for this document: the header name is
taken from the <attr/HTTP-EQUIV/ attribute value, and the header value
is taken from the value of the <attr/CONTENT/ attribute. HTTP header
names are not case sensitive.

<tli>NAME: name of the name/value pair. If not present,
<attr/HTTP-EQUIV/ gives the name.

<tli>CONTENT: The value of the name/value pair.

</tl>

<p>Examples

<p>If the document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Expires"
      CONTENT="Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT">
<meta http-equiv="Keywords" CONTENT="Fred, Barney">
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Reply-to"
      content="fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)">
]]></listing>

<p>then the server should include the following header fields:

<listing><![CDATA[
Expires: Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT
Keywords: Fred, Barney
Reply-to: fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)
]]></listing>

<p>as part of the HTTP response to a <code/GET/ or <code/HEAD/ request
for that document.

<p>When the HTTP-EQUIV attribute is not present, the server should not
generate an HTTP response header for the meta-information; e.g.,

<p>Do not name an HTTP-EQUIV equal to a response header that should
normally only be generated by the HTTP server. Example names that are
inappropriate include <code/Server/, <code/Date/, and
<code/Last-modified/ -- the exact list of inappropriate names is
dependent on the particular server implementation.

<h3>Next Id: NEXTID

<p> They <tag/NEXTID/ element gives a hint for the name to use for an
<tag/A/ element when editing an HTML document. It should be distinct
from all <attr/NAME/ attribute values on <tag/A/ elements. For
example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<NEXTID N=Z27>
]]></listing>
