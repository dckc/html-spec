<h1>Public Text of the HTML 2.0 Specification</h1>

<p> The HTML 2.0 specification includes both machine-readable public
    text -- SGML "code" if you will -- and human-readable text.
    The public text includes the DTD, an SGML declaration, and a version
    of the ISO Added Latin 1 entity set.

<h2> Changes in this Revision </h2>

<ul>

<li> The DTD is no longer spread across three files. The Level 0 and Level 1
     files contain just feature test entities now. The <tt>html.dtd</tt>
     contains all the elements.

<li> The META tag was promoted from Proposed to standard. The Proposed
     feature test entity has been eliminated. (The nbsp and shy entities
     went away with it: they should come back in 2.1)

<li> The HTML.Prescriptive feature test entity is now called HTML.Recommended.
     It switches the content of BODY and A between the "free form" style
     generally found on the net and the more structured, recommended form.

<li> The HTML.Obsolete feature test entity is now called HTML.Deprecated.
     It switches <tt>XMP</tt>, <tt>LISTING</tt>, and <tt>PLAINTEXT</tt>.

<li> The standard A content model now includes <tt>H1</tt>-<tt>H6</tt>
     and <tt>%text</tt> only -- <tt>%block</tt> has been removed.

<li> The public text owner is now <tt>-//IETF//</tt>. If and when the
     IETF becomes a registerd ISO public text owner, the <tt>-//</tt>
     should be changed to <tt>+//</tt>.

<li> The reference to the ISO latin 1 entity set now references the
     HTML version of this entity set, and not the public version
     from the SGML standard.

</ul>
