Dan--

I *think* all the extra scripts are here,
but let me know if you find anything missing.

Put these files in a 'specs' subdirectory, and run:

sgmls snafu.decl filename.sgm | costsh -S specs/snafu-plain.spec > filename.txt

This writes page numbers to an auxilliary file 'cost.aux';
run it again to get the table of contents right.

Make sure that $COSTLIB is set, too.

Let me know if you have any problems,
