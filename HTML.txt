About of this Document

   This document describes the current practice and current proposals
   for future standardisation of HTML, as a basis for review and
   enhancement.
   
   The document is a draft form of a standard for interchange of
   information on the network which is proposed to be registered as a
   MIME (RFC1521) content type.

  VERSION
  
   This is version 2.0 of this document, (released $Date: 1994/06/13
   22:50:44 $) It introduces forms for user input of information, and
   adds a distinction between levels of conformance. Level 0 is the
   minimum conformance level. Level 1 includes phrase-level markup and
   images. Level 2 includes forms. Features of higher levels which are
   under discussion, (such as tables, figures, and mathematical
   formulae) where mentioned are described as "proposed".

Abstract

   HyperText Markup Language (HTML) can be used to represent
   
      Hypertext news, mail, online documentation, and collaborative
      hypermedia;
      
      Menus of options;
      
      Database query results;
      
      Simple structured documents with inlined graphics.
      
      Hypertext views of existing bodies of information
      
   The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links related information
   throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing
   linked information, and all W3 compatible programs are required to
   be capable of handling HTML. W3 uses an Internet protocol
   (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer
   representations to be negotiated between client and server, the
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


   result being returned in an extended MIME message. HTML is
   therefore just one, but an important one, of the representations
   used with W3.
   
   HTML is proposed as a MIME content type.
   
   HTML refers to the URI specification RFCxxxx.
   
   Implementations of HTML parsers and generators can be found in the
   various W3 servers and browsers, in the public domain W3 code, and
   may also be built using various public domain SGML parsers such as
   [SGMLS] . HTML documents are SGML documents with fairly generic
   semantics appropriate for representing information from a wide
   range of applications.

                            Vocabulary usied in the HTML specification
                              VOCABULARY
                                   
   This specification uses the words below with the precise meaning
   given.
   
  Representation         The encoding of information for interchange.
                         For example, HTML is a representation of
                         hypertext.
                         
  Rendering              The form of presentation to information to
                         the human reader.
                         
Imperatives

  may                    The implementation is not obliged to follow
                         this in any way.
                         
  must                   If this is not followed, the implementation
                         does not conform to this specification.
                         
  shall                  as "must"
                         
  should                 If this is not followed, though the
                         implementation officially conforms to the
                         standard, undesirable results may occur in
                         practice.
                         
  typical                Typical rendering is described for many
                         elements. This is not a mandatory part of the
                         standard but is given as guidance for
                         designers and to help explain the uses for
                         which the elements were intended.
                         
Notes

   Sections marked "Note:" are not mandatory parts of the
   specification but for guidance only.
   
Status of features

  Mandatory              These features must be implemented in the
                         rendering. Features are mandatory unless
                         otherwise mentioned.
                         
  Optional               Standard HTML features which may safely be
                         ignored by parsers. It is legal to ignore
                         these, treat the contents as though the tags
                         were not there. (e.g. EM, and processing
                         instructions) . Authors should be aware that
                         these features may be ignored by some
                         applications.
                         
  Proposed               The specification of these features is not
                         final. They should not be regarded as part
                         ofthe standard, but indicate possible
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


                         directions for future versions.
                         
  Obsolete               Not standard HTML. Parsers should implement
                         these features as far as possible in order to
                         preserve back-compatibility with previous
                         versions of this specification.

                                                         HTML and MIME
                            HTML AND MIME
                                   
   The definition of the HTML content subtype is
   
  MIME Type name         text
                         
  MIME subtype name:     html
                         
  Required parameters:   none
                         
  Optional parameters:   level, version, charset
                         
Level

   The level parameter specifies the feature set which is used in the
   document. The level is an integer number, implying that any
   features of same or lower level may be present in the document.
   Levels are defined by this specification.
   
Version

   In order to help avoid future compatibility problems, the version
   parameter may be used to give the version number of this
   specification to which the document conforms. The version number
   appears at the front of this document and within public identifier
   for the SGML DTD.
   
Character sets

   The base character set (the SGML BASESET) for HTML is ISO Latin-1.
   This is the set referred to by any numeric character references.
   The actual character set used in the representation of an HTML
   document may be ISO Latin 1, or its 7-bit subset which is ASCII.
   There is no obligation for an HTML document to contain any
   characters above decimal 127. It is possible that a transport
   medium such as electronic mail imposes constraints on the number of
   bits in a representation of a document, though the HTTP access
   protocol used by W3 always allows 8 bit transfer.
   
   When an HTML document is encoded using 7-bit characters, then the
   mechanisms of character references and entity references may be
   used to encode characters in the upper half of the ISO Latin-1 set.
   In this way, documents may be prepared which are suitable for
   mailing through 7-bit limited systems.
   
  CHARACTER SET OPTION (PROPOSED)
  
   The SGML declaration specified ISO Latin 1 as the base character
   set. The charset parameter is reserved for future use. Its intended
   significance is to override the base character set of the SGML
   declaration. Support of character sets other than ISO-Latin-1 is
   not a requirement for conformance with this specification.

                                    Hypertext Markup language and SGML
                            HTML AND SGML
                                   
   This section describes the relationship between HTML and SGML, and
   guides the newcomer through interpretation of the DTD. (This is not
   a full tutorial on SGML, and in the event of any apparent conflict,
   the SGML standard is definitive.)
   
   The HyperText Markup Language is an application conforming to
   International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup
   Language [ SGML ]. SGML is a system for defining structured
   document types, and markup languages to represent instances of
   those document types.
   
   Every SGML document has three parts:
   
      An SGML declaration, which binds SGML processing quantities and
      syntax token names to specific values. For example, the SGML
      declaration in the HTML DTD specifies that the string that opens
      an end tag is </ and the maximum length of a name is 34
      characters.
      
      A prologue including one or more document type declarations,
      which specifiy the element types, element relationships and
      attributes, and references that can be represented by markup.
      The HTML DTD specifies, for example, that the HEAD element
      contains at most one TITLE element.
      
      An instance, which contains the data and markup of the document.
      
   We use the term HTML to mean both the document type and the markup
   language for representing instances of that document type.
   
   The SGML declaration for HTML is given in the appendix ``SGML
   Delcaration for HTML.'' It is implicit among WWW implementations.
   
   The prologue for an HTML document should look like:
   

      <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3O//DTD W3 HTML 2.0//EN">

  NOTE: MISSING <DOCTYPE DECLARATION
  
   Many extant HTML documents do not contain a prologue.
   Implementations are encouraged to infer the above prologue if the
   document does not begin with <!.

                                               Structured Text in HTML
                           STRUCTURED TEXT
                                   
   An HTML instance is like a text file, except that some of the
   characters are interpreted as markup. The markup gives structure to
   the document.
   
   The instance represents a hierarchy of elements. Each element has a
   name , some attributes , and some content. Most elements are
   represented in the document as a start tag, which gives the name
   and attributes, followed by the content, followed by the end tag.
   For example:
   

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3O//DTD W3 HTML 2.0//EN">
        <HTML>
          <HEAD>
            <TITLE>
              A sample HTML document
            </TITLE>
          </HEAD>

          <BODY>
            <H1>
              An Example of Structure
              <br>
              In HTML
            </H1>
            <P>
              Here's a typical paragraph.
            <UL>
              <LI>
                Item one has an
                <A NAME="anchor">
                  anchor
                </A>
              <LI>
                Here's item two.
            </UL>
          </BODY>
        </HTML>

   Some elements (e.g. BR) are empty. They have no content. They show
   up as just a start tag.
   
   For the rest of the elements, the content is a sequence of data
   characters and nested elements. Some things such as forms and
   anchors cannot be nested, in which case this is mentioned in the
   text. Anchors and character highlighting may be put inside other
   constructs.
   
Tags

   Most elements start and end with tags. Empty elements have no end
   tag. Start tags are delimited by < and >, and end tags are
   delimited by </ and >. For example:
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


   

        <h1> ... </H1>   <!-- uppercase = lowercase  -->
        <h1 > ... </h1 > <!-- spaces OK before > -->

   The following are not valid tags:
   

        < h1>             <!-- this is not a tag at all -->
        <H1/> <H=1>       <!-- these are markup errors -->

  NOTE: SHORTTAG
  
   The SGML declaration for HTML specifies SHORTTAG YES , which means
   that there are some other valid syntaxes for tags, e.g. NET tags:
   <em/.../ , empty start tags: <> , empty end tags: </> . Until such
   time as support for these idioms is widely deployed, their use is
   strongly discouraged.
   
   The start and end tags for the HTML, HEAD, and BODY elements are
   omissable. The end tags of some other elements (e.g. P, LI, DT, DD)
   can be ommitted (see the DTD for details). This does not change the
   document structure -- the following documents are equivalent:
   

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3O//DTD W3 HTML 2.0//EN">
          <TITLE>Structural Example</TITLE>
          <H1>Structural Example</H1>
          <P>A paragraph...

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3O//DTD W3 HTML 2.0//EN">
          <HTML><HEAD>
          <TITLE>Structural Example</TITLE>
          </HEAD>
          <BODY>
          <H1>Structural Example</H1>
          <P>A paragraph...</P>
          </BODY>

  NAMES
  
   The element name immediately follows the tag open delimiter. Names
   consist of a letter followed by up to 33 letters, digits, periods,
   or hyphens. Names are not case sensitive. For example:
   

        A H1 h1 another.name name-with-hyphens

  ATTRIBUTES
  
   In a start tag, whitespace and attributes are allowed between the
   element name and the closing delimiter. An attribute consists of a
   name, an equal sign, and a value. Whitespace is allowed around the
   equal sign.
   
   The value is either:
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 3


   
      A string literal, delimited by single quotes or double quotes,
      or
      
      A name token; that is, a sequence of letters, digits, periods,
      or hyphens.
      
   For example:
   

        <A HREF="http://host/dir/file.html">
        <A HREF=foo.html >
        <IMG SRC="mrbill.gif" ALT="Mr. Bill says, &#34;Oh Noooo&#34;">

   The length of an attribute value (after replacing entity and
   numeric character referencees) is limited to 1024 characters.
   
  NOTE: UNQUOTED ATTRIBUTE VALUE LITERALS
  
   Some implementations allowed any character except space or '>' in a
   name token, for example <A HREF=foo/bar.html> . As a result, there
   are many documents that contain attribute values that should be
   quoted but are not. While parser implementators are encouraged to
   support this idiom, its use in future documents is stictly
   prohibited.
   
  NOTE: > IN ATTRIBUTE VALUE LITERALS
  
   Some implementations also consider any occurence of the > character
   to signal the end of a tag. For compatibility with such
   implementations, it may be necessary to represent > with an entity
   or numeric character reference; for example: <IMG SRC="eq1.ps"
   ALT="a &#62; b">
   
   Attributes with a delcared value of NAME (e.g. ISMAP, COMPACT) may
   be written using a minimized syntax. The markup:
   

        <UL COMPACT="COMPACT">

   can be written as
   

        <UL COMPACT>

Undefined tag and attribute names

   It is a principle to be conservative in that which one produces,
   and liberal in that which one accepts. HTML parsers should be
   liberal except when verifying code. HTML generators should generate
   strictly conforming HTML.
   
   The behaviour of WWW applications reading HTML documents and
   discovering tag or attribute names which they do not understand
   should be to behave as though, in the case of a tag, the whole tag
   had not been there but its content had, or in the case of an
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 4


   attribute, that the attribute had not been present.
   
Character Data

   The characters between the tags represent text in the ISO-Latin-1
   character set, which is a superset of ASCII. Because certain
   characters will be interpreted as markup, they should be "escaped";
   that is, represented by markup -- entity or numeric character
   references. For example:
   

                When a&#60;b, we can show that...
                Brought to you by AT&amp;T

   The HTML DTD includes entities for each of the non-ASCII characters
   so that one may reference them by name if it is inconvenient to
   enter them directly:
   
           Kurt G&ouml;del was a famous logician and mathematician.

  NOTE: MARKUP CHARACTERS
  
   To ensure that a string of characters has no markup, it is
   sufficient to represent all occurrences of < , > , and & by
   character or entity references.
   
  NOTE: CDATA, RCDATA
  
   There are SGML features ( CDATA , RCDATA ) to allow most < , > ,
   and & characters to be entered without the use of entity or
   character references. Because these features tend to be used and
   implemented inconsistently, and because they require 8-bit
   characters to represent non-ASCII characters, they are not employed
   in this version of the HTML DTD. An earlier HTML specification
   included an XMP element whose syntax is not expressible in SGML.
   Inside the XMP , no markup was recognized except the </XMP> end
   tag. While implementations are encouraged to support this idiom,
   its use is obsolete.
   
  COMMENTS
  
   To include comments in an HTML document that will be ignored by the
   parser, surround them with <!-- and -->. After the comment
   delimiter, all text up to the next occurrence of -- is ignored.
   Hence comments cannot be nested. Whitespace is allowed between the
   closing -- and >. (But not between the opening <! and --.)
   
   For example:
   
<HEAD>
<TITLE>HTML Guide: Recommended Usage</TITLE>
<!-- Id: Text.html,v 1.6 1994/04/25 17:33:48 connolly Exp -->
</HEAD>

  NOTE: TAGS IN COMMENTS
  
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 5


   Some historical implementations incorrectly consider a > sign to
   terminate a comment.

                                                      Elements of HTML
                            HTML ELEMENTS
                                   
   This is a discussion of the elements in the HTML language, and how
   they interact to represent documents.
   
The HTML Document Element

   An HTML document is organized as a HEAD and a BODY, much like memo
   or a mail message:
   

          HTML
          |
          |_head
          |_body

   The HEAD element is a small unordered collection of information
   about the document, whereas the BODY is an ordered sequence of
   information elements of arbitrary length. This organization allows
   an implementation to determine certain properties of a document --
   the title, for example -- without parsing the entire document.
   
Information in the HEAD Element

  TITLE                  The title of the document
                         
  ISINDEX                Sent by a server in a searchable document
                         
  NEXTID                 A parameter used by editors to generate
                         unique identifiers
                         
  LINK                   Relationship between this document and
                         another. See also the Anchor element ,
                         Relationships. A document may have many LINK
                         elements.
                         
  BASE                   A record of the URL of the document when
                         saved.
                         
  PROPOSED HEAD ELEMENTS
  
  EXPIRES                The date after which the document should be
                         considered invalid. Semantics as in the HTTP
                         specification.
                         
  META                   A generic mechanism for embedding document
                         metainformation not specified by existing
                         HTML elements.
                         
Body Elements (level 1)

   The order of the contents of the BODY element should be preserved
   when it is rendered on the output device.
   
  HYPERTEXT ANCHORS
Jun 13 17:52 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


  
  Anchors                Sections of text which form the beginning
                         and/or end of hypertext links are called
                         "anchors" and defined by the A tag.
                         
  BLOCK ELEMENTS
  
   These elements typically stack vertically in the rendered flow of
   text. Whitespace between them is ignored.
   
  Headings               Several levels of headings are supported.
                         
  Paragraph              The P element represents a paragraph.
                         
  Horizontal Rule        A horizontal dividing line.
                         
  Address style          Used to represent authorship or status of a
                         document
                         
  Blockquote style       A block of text quoted from another source.
                         
  Lists                  Bulleted lists, glossaries, etc.
                         
  Preformatted text      Sections in fixed-width font for preformatted
                         text.
                         
  INLINE ELEMENTS
  
   These elements fall left to right in the rendered flow of text.
   Whitespace between them separates words, except in the PRE element,
   where it has its literal ASCII meaning.
   
  Special Phrases        Emphasis, typographic distinctions, etc.
                         
  Line Breaks            Indicates a line break in a flow of text.
                         
  IMG                    The IMG tag allows inline graphics.
                         
Body elements (level 2)

  ELEMENTS FOR FORMS
  
   The FORM element and various other elements allowed only within it
   describe forms which allow user input.
   
  FORM elements          FORM, INPUT, SELECT, OPTION, TEXTAREA, etc.
                         
Obsolete elements

   The other elements are obsolete but should be recognised by parsers
   for back-compatibility.

   The HEAD element contains all information about the document in
   general. It does not contain any text which is part of the
   document: this is in the BODY. Within the head element, only
   certain elements are allowed.

                                             The TITLE element in HTML
                                TITLE
                                   
   The title of a document is specified by the TITLE element. The
   TITLE element must occur in the HEAD of the document.
   
   There may only be one title in any document. It should identify the
   content of the document in a fairly wide context.
   
   It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks, or highlighting. The
   title may be used to identify the node in a history list, to label
   the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally displayed
   in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with headings .
   The title should ideally be less than 64 characters in length. That
   is, many applications will display document titles in window
   titles, menus, etc where there is only limited room. Whilst there
   is no limit on the length of a title (as it may be automatically
   generated from other data), information providers are warned that
   it may be truncated if long.
   
  EXAMPLES OF USE
  
   Appropriate titles might be
   
                <TITLE>Rivest and Neuman. 1989(b)</TITLE>

   or
   
                <TITLE>A Recipe for Maple Syrup Flap-Jack</TITLE>

   or
   
                <TITLE>Introduction -- AFS user's Guide</TITLE>

   Examples of inappropriate titles are those which are only
   meaningful within context,
   
                <TITLE>Introduction</TITLE>

   or too long,
   
        <TITLE>Remarks on the Quantum-Gravity effects of "Bean
        Pole" diversification in Mononucleosis patients in Developing
        Countries under Economic Conditions Prevalent during
        the Second half of the Twentieth Century, and Related Papers:

                                               ISINDEX element in HTML
                               ISINDEX
                                   
   This element informs the reader that the document is an index
   document. As well as reading it, the reader may use a keyword
   search.
   
   The node may be queried with a keyword search by suffixing the node
   address with a question mark, followed by a list of keywords
   separated by plus signs. See the network address format .
   
   Note that this tag is normally generated automatically by a server.
   If it is added by hand to an HTML document, then the client will
   assume that the server can handle a search on the document.
   Obviously the server must have this capability for it to work:
   simply adding <ISINDEX> in the document is not enough to make
   searches happen if the server does not have a search engine!
   
   Status: standard.
   
Example of use:

                <ISINDEX>

                                 LINK
                                   
   The LINK element occurs within the HEAD element of an HTML
   document. It is used to indicate a relationship between the
   document and some other object. A document may have any number of
   LINK elements.
   
   The LINK element is empty, but takes the same attributes as the
   anchor element .
   
   Typical uses are to indicate authorship, related indexes and
   glossaries, older or more recent versions, etc. Links can indicate
   a static tree structure in which the document was authored by
   pointing to a "parent" and "next" and "previous" document, for
   example.
   
   Servers may also allow links to be added by those who do not have
   the right to alter the body of a document.

   This element allows the URL of the document itself to be recorded
   in situations in which the document may be read out of context.
   URLs within the document may be in a "partial" form relative to
   this base address.
   
   Where the base address is not specified, the reader will use the
   URL it used to access the document to resolve any relative URLs.
   
   The one attribute is:
   
  HREF                   the URL

   This tag takes a single attribute which is the number of the next
   document-wide numeric identifier to be allocated of the form z123.
   
   When modifying a document, old anchor ids should not be reused, as
   there may be references stored elsewhere which point to them. This
   is read and generated by hypertext editors. Human writers of HTML
   usually use mnemonic alphabetical identifiers. Browser software may
   ignore this tag.
   
Example of use:

                <NEXTID N=z27>

                                   The META element in HTML (proposed)
                           META (PROPOSED)
                                   
   The META element can be used within the HEAD element to embed
   document metainformation not defined by other HTML elements. Such
   information can be extracted by servers/clients for use in
   identifying, indexing, and cataloging specialized document
   metainformation.
   
   Although it is generally preferable to use named elements which
   have well-defined semantics for each type of metainformation (e.g.
   TITLE), this element is provided for situations where strict SGML
   parsing is necessary and the local DTD is not extensible.
   
   In addition, HTTP servers can read the content of the document HEAD
   to generate response headers corresponding to any elements defining
   a value for the attribute HTTP-EQUIV. This provides document
   authors a mechanism (not necessarily the preferred one) for
   identifying information which should be included in the response
   headers for an HTTP request.
   
   The attributes of the META element are:
   
  HTTP-EQUIV             This attribute binds the element to an HTTP
                         response header. It means that if you know
                         the semantics of the HTTP response header
                         named by this attribute, then you can process
                         the contents based on a well-defined
                         syntactic mapping, whether or not your DTD
                         tells you anything about it. HTTP header
                         names are not case sensitive. If not present,
                         the attribute NAME should be used to identify
                         this metainformation and it should not be
                         used within an HTTP response header.
                         
  NAME                   Metainformation name. If not present, the
                         name can be assumed equal to the value of
                         HTTP-EQUIV.
                         
  CONTENT                The metainformation content to be associated
                         with the given name and/or HTTP response
                         header.
                         
Examples of use

   If the document contains:
   

    <expires http-equiv="Expires">Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT</expir
es>
    <meta http-equiv="Keywords" content="Fred, Barney, Wilma">
    <meta http-equiv="Reply-to" content="fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fie
lding)">

   The server may include the headers:
   
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2



    Expires: Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT
    Keywords: Fred, Barney, Wilma
    Reply-to: fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)

   as part of the HTTP response to a GET or HEAD request for that
   document.
   
   When the HTTP-EQUIV attribute is not present, the server should not
   generate an HTTP response header for this metainformation; e.g.,
   

    <meta name="IndexType" content="Service">

   would not generate an HTTP response header but would still allow
   clients or other tools to make use of that metainformation.
   
Examples of misuse

   One example of an inappropriate usage for the META element is to
   use it to define information that should be associated with an
   already existing HTML element, e.g.
   

    <meta name="Title" content="The Etymology of Dunsel">

   A second example of inappropriate usage is to name an HTTP-EQUIV
   equal to a response header that should normally only be generated
   by the HTTP server. Example names that are inappropriate include
   "Server", "Date", and "Last-modified" -- the exact list of
   inappropriate names is dependent on the particular server
   implementation. It is recommended that servers ignore any META
   elements which specify http-equivalents which are equal
   (case-insensitively) to their own reserved response headers.

                                            The Anchor element in HTML
                               ANCHORS
                                   
   An anchor is a piece of text which marks the beginning and/or the
   end of a hypertext link.
   
   The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the
   start or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor
   tag are as follows.
   
  HREF                   OPTIONAL. If the HREF attribute is present,
                         the anchor is sensitive text: the start of a
                         link. If the reader selects this text, (s)he
                         should be presented with another document
                         whose network address is defined by the value
                         of the HREF attribute . The format of the
                         network address is specified elsewhere . This
                         allows for the form HREF="#identifier" to
                         refer to another anchor in the same document.
                         If the anchor is in another document, the
                         attribute is a relative name , relative to
                         the documents address (or specified base
                         address if any).
                         
  NAME                   OPTIONAL. If present, the attribute NAME
                         allows the anchor to be the destination of a
                         link. The value of the attribute is an
                         identifier for the anchor. Identifiers are
                         arbitrary strings but must be unique within
                         the HTML document. Another document can then
                         make a reference explicitly to this anchor by
                         putting the identifier after the address,
                         separated by a hash sign .
                         
  REL                    OPTIONAL. An attribute REL may give the
                         relationship (s) described by the hypertext
                         link. The value is a comma-separated list of
                         relationship values. Values and their
                         semantics will be registered by the HTML
                         registration authority . The default
                         relationship if none other is given is void.
                         REL should not be present unless HREF is
                         present. See Relationship values , REV .
                         
  REV                    OPTIONAL. The same as REL , but the semantics
                         of the link type are in the reverse
                         direction. A link from A to B with REL="X"
                         expresses the same relationship as a link
                         from B to A with REV="X". An anchor may have
                         both REL and REV attributes.
                         
  URN                    OPTIONAL. If present, this specifies a
                         uniform resource number for the document. See
                         note .
                         
  TITLE                  OPTIONAL. This is informational only. If
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


                         present the value of this field should equal
                         the value of the TITLE of the document whose
                         address is given by the HREF attribute. See
                         note .
                         
  METHODS                OPTIONAL. The value of this field is a string
                         which if present must be a comma separated
                         list of HTTP METHODS supported by the object
                         for public use. See note .
                         
   All attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is
   necessary for the anchor to be useful. See also: LINK .
   
Example of use:

        See <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</A>'s information for
        more details.

        A <A NAME=serious>serious</A> crime is one which is associated

   This is useful for at least two reasons
   
      The browser software may chose to display the title of the
      document as a preliminary to retrieving it, for example as a
      margin note or on a small box while the mouse is over the
      anchor, or during document fetch.
      
      Some documents -- mainly those which are not marked up text,
      such as graphics, plain text and also Gopher menus, do not come
      with a title themselves, and so putting a title in the link is
      the only way to give them a title. This is how Gopher works.
      Obviously it leads to duplication of data, and so it is
      dangerous to assume that the title attribute of the link is a
      valid and unique title for the destination document.

   The METHODS attributes of anchors and links are used to provide
   information about the functions which the user may perform on an
   object. These are more accurately given by the HTTP protocol when
   it is used, but it may, for similar reasons as for the TITLE
   attribute, be useful to include the information in advance in the
   link.
   
   For example, The browser may chose a different rendering as a
   function of the methods allowed (for example something which is
   searchable may get a different icon)

                                              Heading elements in HTML
                               HEADINGS
                                   
   Six levels of heading are supported. (Note that a hypertext node
   within a hypertext work tends to need fewer levels of heading than
   a work whose only structure is given by the nesting of headings.)
   
   A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks
   before and after, and white space (for example) necessary to render
   the heading. Further character emphasis or paragraph marks are not
   required in HTML.
   
   H1 is the highest level of heading, and is recommended for the
   start of a hypertext node. It is suggested that the the text of the
   first heading be suitable for a reader who is already browsing in
   related information, in contrast to the title tag which should
   identify the node in a wider context.
   
   The heading elements are
   
                <H1>, <H2>, <H3>, <H4>, <H5>, <H6>

   It is not normal practice to jump from one header to a header level
   more than one below, for example for follow an H1 with an H3.
   Although this is legal, it is discouraged, as it may produce
   strange results for example when generating other representations
   from the HTML.
   
Example:

                <H1>This is a heading</H1>
                Here is some text
                <H2>Second level heading</H2>
                Here is some more text.

Parser Note:

   Parsers should not require any specific order to heading elements,
   even if the heading level increases by more than one between
   successive headings.
   
Typical Rendering

  H1                     Bold very large font, centered. One or two
                         lines clear space between this and anything
                         following. If printed on paper, start new
                         page.
                         
  H2                     Bold, large font, flush left against left
                         margin, no indent. One or two clear lines
                         above and below.
                         
  H3                     Italic, large font, slightly indented from
                         the left margin. One or two clear lines above
                         and below.
                         
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


  H4                     Bold, normal font, indented more than H3. One
                         clear line above and below.
                         
  H5                     Italic, normal font, indented as H4. One
                         clear line above.
                         
  H6                     Bold, indented same as normal text, more than
                         H5. One clear line above.
                         
   These typical values are just an indication, and it is up to the
   designer of the presentation software to define the styles. The
   reader may have options to customize these. When writing documents,
   you should assume that whatever is done it is designed to have the
   same sort of effect as the styles above.
   
   The rendering software is responsible for generating suitable
   vertical white space between elements, so it is NOT normal or
   required to follow a heading element with a paragraph mark.

                                                    Paragraphs in HTML
                             P: PARAGRAPH
                                   
   The empty P element represents a paragraph. The exact rendering of
   this (indentation, leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a
   function of other tags, style sheets etc.
   
   You do NOT need to use <P> to put white space around heading, list,
   address or blockquote elements. It is the responsibility of the
   rendering software to generate that white space. An empty paragraph
   has undefined effect and should be avoided.
   
Typical rendering

   Typically, paragraphs are surrounded by a small vertical space (of
   a line or half a line). This is not the case (typically) within
   ADDRESS or (ever) within PRE elements. With some implementations,
   normal paragraphs may have a small extra left indent on the first
   line.
   
Examples of use

        <h1>What to do</h1>
        <p>This is a one paragraph.<P>This is a second.
        <P>
        This is a third.

Bad example

        <h1><P>What not to do</h1>
        <address><p>I found that on my XYZ browser it looked prettier
to
        me if I put some paragraph tags</address>
        <p>
        <ul><p><li>Around lists, and
        <li>Inside headings.
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h2>None of the paragraph tags in this example should
        be there.</h2>

   The line break element marks that a new line must be started at the
   given point.
   
Typical rendering

   A new line with indent the same as that of line-wrapped text.
   
Examples

   These elements allow sections of text to be formatted in a
   particular way, to provide emphasis, etc. The tags do NOT cause a
   paragraph break, and may be used on sections of text within
   paragraphs.
   
   Where not supported by implementations, like all tags, these tags
   should be ignored but the content rendered.
   
   All these tags have related closing tags, as in
   
                This is <EM>emphasized</EM> text.

   Some of these styles are more explicit than others about how they
   should be physically represented. The logical styles should be used
   wherever possible, unless for example it is necessary to refer to
   the formatting in the text. (Eg, "The italic parts are mandatory".)
   
  NOTE:
  
   Browsers unable to display a specified style may render it in some
   alternative, or the default, style, with some loss of quality for
   the reader. Some implementations may ignore these tags altogether,
   so information providers should attempt not to rely on them as
   essential to the information content.
   
   These element names are derived from TeXInfo macro names.
   
Physical styles

  TT                     Fixed-width typewriter font.

                                               The IMG Element in HTML
                         IMG: EMBEDDED IMAGES
                                   
   Status: Extra
   
   The IMG element allows another document to be inserted inline. The
   document is normally an icon or small graphic, etc. This element is
   NOT intended for embedding other HTML text.
   
   Browsers which are not able to display inline images ignore IMG
   elements. Authors should note that some browsers will be able to
   display (or print) linked graphics but not inline graphics. If the
   graphic is essential, it may be wiser to make a link to it rather
   than to put it inline. If the graphic is essentially decorative,
   then IMG is appropriate.
   
   The IMG element is empty: it has no closing tag. It has two
   attributes:
   
  SRC                    The value of this attribute is the URL of the
                         document to be embedded. Its syntax is the
                         same as that of the HREF attribute of the A
                         tag. SRC is mandatory.
                         
  ALIGN                  Take values TOP or MIDDLE or BOTTOM, defining
                         whether the tops or middles of bottoms of the
                         graphics and text should be aligned
                         vertically.
                         
  ALT                    Optional alternative text as an alternative
                         to the graphics for display in text-only
                         environments.
                         
   Note that IMG elements are allowed within anchors.
   
Example

        Warning: < IMG SRC ="triangle.gif" ALT="Warning:"> This must b
e done by a
        qualified technician.

   This element is for address information, signatures, authorship,

Typical rendering

   Typically, an address element is italic and/or right justified or

   The BLOCKQUOTE element allows text quoted from another source to be
   rendered specially.
   
Typical rendering

   A typical rendering might be a slight extra left and right indent,
   and/or italic font. BLOCKQUOTE causes a paragraph break, and
   typically a line or so of white space will be allowed between it
   and any text before or after it.
   
   Single-font rendition may for example put a vertical line of ">"
   characters down the left margin to indicate quotation in the
   Internet mail style.

                        FORMS OF LIST IN HTML
                                   
   These lists may be nested
   
Glossaries

   A glossary (or definition list) is a list of paragraphs each of
   which has a short title alongside it. Apart from glossaries, this
   element is useful for presenting a set of named elements to the
   reader. The elements within a glossary follow are introduced by
   these elements:
   
  DT                     The "term", typically placed in a wide left
                         indent.
                         
  DD                     The "definition", which may wrap onto many
                         lines
                         
   These elements must appear in pairs. Single occurrences of DT
   without a following DD are allowed, and have the same significance
   as if the DD had been present with no text. The one attribute which
   DL can take is
   
  COMPACT                suggests that a compact rendering be used,
                         because the enclosed elements are
                         individually small, or the whole glossary is
                         rather large, or both.
                         
  TYPICAL RENDERING
  
   The definition list DT, DD pairs are arranged vertically. For each
   pair, the DT element is on the left, in a column of about a third
   of the display area, and the DD element is in the right hand two
   thirds of the display area. The DT term is normally small enough to
   fit on one line within the left-hand column. If it is longer, it
   will either extend across the page, in which case the DD section is
   moved down to separate them, or it is wrapped onto successive lines
   of the left hand column.
   
   This is sometimes implemented with the use of a large negative
   first line indent.
   
   White space is typically left between successive DT,DD pairs unless
   the COMPACT attribute is given. The COMPACT attribute is
   appropriate for lists which are long and/or have DT,DD pairs which
   each take only a line or two. It is of course possible for the
   rendering software to discover these cases itself and make its own
   decisions, and this is to be encouraged.
   
   The COMPACT attribute may also reduce the width of the left-hand
   (DT) column.

Lists

   A list is a sequence of paragraphs, each of which may be preceded
   by a special mark or sequence number. The syntax is:
   

                <UL>
                <LI> list element
                <LI> another list element ...
                </UL>

   The opening list tag may be any of UL, OL, MENU or DIR. It must be
   immediately followed by the first list element.
   
  TYPICAL RENDERING
  
   The representation of the list is not defined here, but a bulleted
   list for unordered lists, and a sequence of numbered paragraphs for
   an ordered list would be quite appropriate. Other possibilities for
   interactive display include embedded scrollable browse panels.
   
   List elements with typical rendering are:
   
  UL                     A list of multi-line paragraphs, typically
                         separated by some white space and/or marked
                         by bullets, etc.
                         
  OL                     As UL, but the paragraphs are typically
                         numbered in some way to indicate the order as
                         significant.
                         
  MENU                   A list of smaller paragraphs. Typically one
                         line per item, with a style more compact than
                         UL.
                         
  DIR                    A list of short elements, typically less than
                         20 characters. These may be arranged in
                         columns across the page, typically 24
                         character in width. If the rendering software
                         is able to optimize the column width as
                         function of the widths of individual
                         elements, so much the better.

                                               The PRE element in HTML
                        PRE: PREFORMATTED TEXT
                                   
   Preformatted elements in HTML are displayed with text in a fixed
   width font, and so are suitable for text which has been formatted
   for a teletype by some existing formatting system.
   


   The optional attribute is:
   
  WIDTH                  This attribute gives the maximum number of
                         characters which will occur on a line. It
                         allows the presentation system to select a
                         suitable font and indentation. Where the
                         WIDTH attribute is not recognized, it is
                         recommended that a width of 80 be assumed.
                         Where WIDTH is supported, it is recommended
                         that at least widths of 40, 80 and 132
                         characters be presented optimally, with other
                         widths being rounded up.
                         
   Within a PRE element,
   
      Line boundaries within the text are rendered as a move to the
      beginning of the next line, except for one immediately following
      or immediately preceding a tag.
      
      The <p> tag should not be used. If found, it should be rendered
      as a move to the beginning of the next line.
      
      Anchor elements and character highlighting elements may be used.
      
      Elements which define paragraph formatting (Headings, Address,
      etc) must not be used.
      
      The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character must be interpreted as
      the smallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave
      the number of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8.
      Its use is not recommended however.
      
  EXAMPLE OF USE
  
                        <PRE WIDTH="80">
                        This is an example line
                        </PRE>

  NOTE: HIGHLIGHTING
  
   Within a preformatted element, the constraint that the rendering
   must be on a fixed horizontal character pitch may limit or prevent
   the ability of the renderer to render highlighting elements
   specially.
   
  NOTE: MARGINS
  
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


   The above references to the "beginning of a new line" must not be
   taken as implying that the renderer is forbidden from using a
   (constant) left indent for rendering preformatted text. The left
   indent may of course be constrained by the width required.

                                              User Input Forms in HTML
                   FILL-OUT FORMS AND INPUT FIELDS
                                   
   Forms are composed by placing input fields within paragraphs,
   preformatted/literal text, lists and tables. This gives
   considerable scope in designing the layout of forms.
   
Elements

   The form features use the following elements which are all known as
   HTML level 2 elements.
   
  FORM                   a form within a document.
                         
  INPUT                  one input field.
                         
  TEXTAREA               a multline input field.
                         
  SELECT                 A selection from a finite set of options.
                         
  OPTION                 one option within a SELECT.
                         
  Proposed Elements
                         
  HTEXTAREA              an input field for hypertext.
                         
   Each variable field is defined by an INPUT , TEXTAREA, or OPTION
   element and must have an NAME attribute which uniquely names the
   field in the document. Additional optional attributes can be used
   to specify the type of the field (defaults to free text), its
   size/precision, its initial value and whether the field is
   currently disabled or in error:
   
Example

   Servers can disable forms by sending an appropriate header or by an
   attribute on the optional HTMLPLUS element at the very start of the
   document, e.g. <htmlplus forms=off>.
   
   Here, the <P> and <UL> elements have been used to lay out the text
   (and input fields. The browser has changed the background color
   within the FORM element to distinguish the form from other parts of
   the document. The browser is responsible for handling the input
   focus, i.e. which field will currently get keyboard input.
   
   For many platforms there will be existing conventions for forms,
   e.g. "tab" and "shift-tab" keys to move the keyboard focus forwards
   and backwards between fields, while an "Enter" key submits the
   form. In the example, the "submit" and "reset" buttons are
   specified explicitly with special purpose fields. The "submit"
   button is used to email the form or send its contents to the server
   as specified by the ACTION attribute, while the "reset" button
   resets the fields to their initial values. When the form consists
   of a single text field, it may be appropriate to leave such buttons
   out and rely on the "Enter" key.
   
   The INPUT element is used for a large variety of typed of input
   fields.
   
   When you need to let users enter more than one line of text, you
   should use the TEXTAREA element.
   
Representing choices

   The RADIO and CHECKBOX types of INPUT field can be used to specify
   multiple choice forms in which every alternative is visible as part
   of the form. An alternative is to use the SELECT element which is
   generally rendered in a more compact fashion as a pull down combo
   list.

                                                      FORM -- Elements
                                 FORM
                                   
   The FORM element is used to delimit the form . There can be several
   forms in a single document, but the FORM element can't be nested.
   
   The ACTION attribute specifies a URL that designates an HTTP server
   or an email address. If missing, the URL for the document itself
   will be assumed. The effect of the action can be modified by
   including a method prefix, e.g. ACTION="POST http://...." . This
   prefix is used to select the HTTP method when sending the form's
   contents to an HTTP server. [[Would it be cleaner to use a separate
   attribute, e.g. METHOD ?]

                                             The INPUT element in HTML
                                INPUT
                                   
   The INPUT element represents a field whose contents may be edited
   by the user. It has the following attributes.
   
  NAME                   Symbolic name used when transferring the
                         form's contents. This attribute is always
                         needed and should uniquely identify this
                         field.
                         
  TYPE                   Defines the type of data the field accepts.
                         Defaults to free text.
                         
  SIZE                   Specifies the size or precision of the field
                         according to its type.
                         
  MAXLENGTH              The maximum number of characters that will be
                         accepted as input. This can be greater that
                         specified by SIZE , in which case the field
                         will scroll appropriately. The default is
                         unlimited.
                         
  VALUE                  The initial value for the field, or the value
                         when checked for checkboxes and radio
                         buttons. This attribute is required for radio
                         buttons.
                         
  SRC                    A URL or URN specifying an image - for use
                         only with TYPE=IMAGEMAP.
                         
  ALIGN                  Vertical alignment of the image - for use
                         only with TYPE=IMAGEMAP.
                         
  PROPSED
  
  CHECKED                When present indicates that a checkbox or
                         radio button is selected.
                         
  DISABLED               When present indicates that this field is
                         temporarily disabled. Browsers should show
                         this by "greying it" out in some manner.
                         
  ERROR                  When present indicates that the field's
                         initial value is in error in some way, e.g.
                         because it is inconsistent with the values of
                         other fields. Servers should include an
                         explanatory error message with the form's
                         text.
                         
Types

   The following types of fields can be defined with the TYPE
   attribute :
   
  TEXT                   Single line text entry fields. Use the SIZE
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


                         attribute to specify the visible width in
                         characters, e.g. SIZE="24" for a 24 character
                         field. The MAX attribute can be used to
                         specify an upper limit to the number of
                         characters that can be entered into a text
                         field, e.g. MAX=72 . Use the TEXTAREA element
                         for text fields which can accept multiple
                         lines (see below).
                         
  HIDDEN                 No field is presented to the user, but the
                         content of the field is sent with the
                         submitted form. This value may be used to
                         transmit state information about
                         client/server interaction.
                         
  CHECKBOX               Used for simple Boolean attributes, or for
                         attributes which can take multiple values at
                         the same time. The latter is represented by a
                         number of checkbox fields each of which has
                         the same NAME .
                         
  RADIO                  For attributes which can take a single value
                         from a set of alternatives. Each radio button
                         field in the group should be given the same
                         NAME .
                         
  SUBMIT                 This is a button that when pressed submits
                         the form. It offers authors control over the
                         location of this button. You can use an image
                         as a submit button by specifying a URL with
                         the SRC attribute.
                         
  RESET                  This is a button that when pressed resets the
                         form's fields to their initial values as
                         specified by the VALUE attribute. You can use
                         an image as a reeset button by specifying a
                         URL with the SRC attribute.
                         
  PROPOSED TYPES
  
  RANGE                  This allows you to specify an integer range
                         with the MIN and MAX attributes, e.g. MIN=1
                         MAX=100 . Users can select any value in this
                         range.
                         
  INT                    For entering integer numbers, the maximum
                         number of digits can be specified with the
                         SIZE attribute (excluding the sign
                         character), e.g. size=3 for a three digit
                         number.
                         
  FLOAT                  For fields which can accept floating point
                         numbers.
                         
  SCRIBBLE               A field upon which you can write with a pen
                         or mouse. The size of the field in
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 3


                         millimeters is given as SIZE= width , height.
                         The units are absolute as they relate to the
                         dimensions of the human hand, rather than
                         pixels of varying resolution. The scribble
                         may involve time and pressure data in
                         addition to the basic ink data. You can use
                         scribble for signatures or sketches. The
                         field can be initialised by setting the SRC
                         attribute to a URL which contains the ink *2
                         . The VALUE attribute is ignored.
                         
  AUDIO                  This provides a way of entering spoken
                         messages into a form. Browsers might show an
                         icon which when clicked pops-up a set of tape
                         controls that you can use to record and
                         replay messages. The initial message can be
                         set by specifying a URL with the SRC
                         attribute. The VALUE attribute is ignored.
                         
  OBSOLETE TYPES
  
  DATE                   Fields which can accept a recognized date
                         format.
                         
  URL                    For fields which expect document references
                         as URLs or URNs.
                         
  IMAGE                  This allows you to specify an image field
                         upon which you can click with a pointing
                         device. The SRC and ALIGN attributes are
                         exactly the same as for the IMG and IMAGE
                         elements. The symbolic names for the x and y
                         coordinates of the click event are specified
                         with .x and .y for the given with the NAME
                         attribute. The VALUE attribute is ignored.
                         
   When you need to let users enter more than one line of text, you
   should use the TEXTAREA element.

                                          The TEXTAREA element in HTML
                               TEXTAREA
                                   
   When you need to let users enter more than one line of text, you
   should use the TEXTAREA element, e.g.
   
<TEXTAREA NAME="address" ROWS=64 COLS=6>
Hewlett Packard Laboratories
1501 Page Mill Road
Palo Alto, California 94304-1126
</TEXTAREA>

   The text up to the end tag is used to initialize the field's value.
   This end tag is always required even if the field is initially
   blank.
   
Typical rendering

   The ROWS and COLS attributes determine the visible dimension of the
   field in characters. The field is rendered in a fixed-width font.
   Browsers are recommended to allow text to grow beyond these limits
   by scrolling as needed.
   
Explanatory Note: TEXTAREA and INPUT/TEXT

   In the initial design for forms, multi-line text fields were
   supported by the INPUT element with TYPE=TEXT . Unfortunately, this
   causes problems for fields with long text values as SGML limits the
   length of attribute literals. The HTML+ DTD allows for up to 1024
   characters (the SGML default is only 240 characters!).

                                            The SELECT element in HTML
                                SELECT
                                   
   The SELECT element allows the user to chose one of a set of
   alternatives described by textual labels. Every alternative is
   represented by the OPTION element.
   
Attributes

  MULTIPLE               The MULTIPLE attribute is needed when users
                         are allowed to make several selections, e.g.
                         <SELECT MULTIPLE> .
                         
  PROPOSED ATTRIBUTES
  
  ERROR                  The ERROR attribute can be used to indicate
                         that the initial selection is in error in
                         some way, e.g. because it is inconsistent
                         with the values of other fields.
                         
Typical rendering

   SELECT is typically rendered as a pull down or pop-up list.
   
Example

   e.g.
   
                <SELECT NAME="flavor">
                <OPTION>Vanilla
                <OPTION>Strawberry
                <OPTION>Rum and Raisin
                <OPTION>Peach and Orange
                </SELECT>

                                            The OPTION element in HTML
                                OPTION
                                   
   The OPTION element can only occur within a SELECT element. It
   represents one choice, and can take the following attributes:
   
  SELECTED               Indicates that this option is initially
                         selected.
                         
  VALUE                  When present indicates the value to be
                         returned if this option is chosen. The
                         returned value defaults to the contents of
                         the option element.
                         
  PROPOSED ATTRIBUTES
  
  DISABLED               When present indicates that this option is
                         temporarily disabled. Browsers typically show
                         this by "greying it", etc.
                         
   The contents of the OPTION element is presented to the user to
   represent the option. It is used as a returned value if the VALUE
   attribute is not present.

                                             Obsolete Elements of HTML
                          OBSOLETE ELEMENTS
                                   
   The following elements of HTML are obsolete. It is recommended that
   client implementors implement the obsolete forms for compatibility
   with old servers.
   
  PLAINTEXT
  
   Status: Obsolete.
   
   The empty PLAINTEXT tag terminates the HTML entity. What follows is
   not SGML. In stead, there's an old HTTP convention that what
   follows is an ASCII (MIME "text/plain") body.
   
   An example if its use is:
   
                        <PLAINTEXT>
                        0001 This is line one of a ling listing
                        0002 file from <any@host.inc.com> which is sen
t

   This tag allows the rest of a file to be read efficiently without
   parsing. Its presence is an optimization. There is no closing tag.
   The rest of the data is not in SGML.
   
  XMP AND LISTING: EXAMPLE SECTIONS
  
   Status: Obsolete. This are in use and should be recognized by
   browsers. New servers should use <PRE> instead.
   
   These styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded
   absolutely as is into the document. The syntax is:
   
                        <LISTING>
                                ...
                        </LISTING>

   or
   
                        <XMP>
                                ...
                        </XMP>

   The text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed width
   font, so that any formatting done by character spacing on
   successive lines will be maintained. Between the opening and
   closing tags:
   
      The text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, but not
      the end tag opener. (See Historical note )
      
      Line boundaries are significant, except any occurring
      immediately after the opening tag or before the closing tag. and
      are to be rendered as a move to the start of a new line.
      
Jun 13 17:53 1994  HTML Specification	 Connolly and Berners-Lee Page 2


      The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character must be interpreted as
      the smallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave
      the number of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8.
      Its use is not recommended however.
      
   The LISTING element is portrayed so that at least 132 characters
   will fit on a line. The XMP  elementis portrayed in a font so that
   at least 80 characters will fit on a line but is otherwise
   identical to LISTING.
   
  HIGHLIGHTED PHRASE HP1 ETC
  
   Status: Obsolete. These tags like all others should be ignored if
   not implemented. Replaced will more meaningful elements -- see
   character highlighting .
   
    Examples of use:
    
                <HP1>...</HP1>   <HP2>... </HP2> etc.

  COMMENT ELEMENT
  
   Status: Obsolete
   
   A comment element used for bracketing off unneed text and comment
   has been introduced in some browsers but will be replaced by the
   SGML command feature in new implementations.

                                      XMP and LISTING in HTML: History
                   HISTORICAL NOTE: XMP AND LISTING
                                   
   The XMP and LISTING elements used historically to have non SGML
   conforming specifications, in that the text could contain any ISO
   Latin printable characters, including the tag opener, so long as it
   does not contain the closing tag in full.
   
   This form is not supported by SGML and so is not the specified HTML
   interpretation. Providers should be warned that implementations may
   vary on how they interpret end tags apparently within these
   elements

   The HTML document type was designed initially at CERN in 1990 for
   the World-Wide Web project. The DTD was written, and the
   specification tightened up, by Dan Connolly in 1992.
   
   An internet draft was release in June of 1992 after much discussion
   on the network and some enhancement in particular the addition of
   inline images introduced by the NCSA "Mosaic" software for WWW.
   
   The FORMS material is derived from the HTML+ specification with the
   help of Dave Raggett.
   
   This document is the work of many contributors. Many thanks to Erik
   Naggum and James Clark for making SGML technology available, and to
   Terry Allen, Dave Raggett, Marc Andressen, William Perry, and the
   rest of the WWW community.
