<h1>Introduction

The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple data format
used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform
to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics
that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
domains.

<h2>Scope

HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) global information
initiative since 1990. This specification corresponds to the
capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994 and referred to
as "HTML 2.0".

HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 <emph>Information
Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup
Language</emph> (SGML). The HTML Document Type Definition (DTD) is a
formal definition of the HTML syntax in terms of SGML.

This specification also defines HTML as an Internet Media
Type[IMEDIA] and MIME Content Type[MIME] called
<code>text/html</>, or <code>text/html; version=2.0</>. As such, it
defines the semantics of the HTML syntax and how that syntax should be
interpreted by user agents.

<h2>Conformance

This specification governs the syntax of HTML documents and the
behaviour of HTML user agents.

<h3>Documents

A document is a conforming HTML document only if:

<ul>
<li>It is a conforming SGML document.

<li>It conforms to the application conventions in this
specification. For example, the value of the <code/HREF/ attribute of
the <tag/A/ element must conform to the URI syntax.

</ul>


<note>There are a number of syntactic idioms that are not supported or
are supported inconsistently in some historical user agent
implementations. These idioms are called out in notes like this
throughout this specification.

HTML documents should not contain these idioms, at least until such
time as support for them is widely deployed.
</note>

The HTML DTD defines a standard HTML document type and several
variations, based on feature test entities:

<tl>
<tli>HTML.Recommended: Certain features of the language are
necessary for compatibility with widespread usage, but they may
compromise the structural integrity of a document.  This feature test
entity enables a more prescriptive document type definition that
eliminates those features.

For example, in order to preserve the structure of a document, an
editing user agent may translate HTML documents to the recommended
subset, or it may require that the documents be in the recommended
subset for import.

<tli>HTML.Deprecated: Certain features of the language are
necessary for compatibility with earlier versions of the
specification, but they tend to be used an implemented inconsistently,
and their use is deprecated. This feature test entity enables a
document type definition that eliminates these features.

Documents generated by tranlation software or editing software should not
contain these idioms.

</tl>

<h3>User Agents

An HTML user agent conforms to this specification if:

<ul>
<li>It parses the characters of an HTML document into data characters
and markup as per [SGML].

<li>It behaves identically for documents whose parsed token sequences
are identical.

For example, comments and the whitespace in tags disappear during
tokenization, and hence they do not influence the behaviour of
conforming user agents.

<li>It allows the user to traverse (or at least attempt to traverse,
resources permitting) all hyperlinks in an HTML document.

<li>It allows the user to express all form field values specified in
an HTML document and to (attempt to) submit the values as requests to
information services.

</ul>

<note>
In the interest of robustness and extensibility, there are a number
of widely deployed conventions for handling non-conforming documents.
See <hdref refid=conv1> for details.
