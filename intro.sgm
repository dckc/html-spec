<h1>Introduction

The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language
used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform
to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics
that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
domains.

<h2>Scope

HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) global information
initiative since 1990. This specification corresponds to the
capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994 and referred to
as "HTML 2.0".

This specification defines HTML as an application of ISO Standard
8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML provides a formal definition
of the HTML syntax in the form of a Document Type Definition (DTD).

This specification also defines HTML as an Internet Media
Type[IMEDIA] and MIME Content Type[MIME] called
<code>text/html</>, or <code>text/html; version=2.0</>. As such, it
defines the semantics of the HTML syntax and how that syntax should be
interpreted by user agents.

<h2>Terms

<p>This specification defines the following terms:

<tl>
<tli>character: An atom of information, for example a letter or a
digit.  Graphic characters have associated glyphs, where as control
characters have associated processing semantics.

<tli>character encoding scheme: A function whose domain is the set of
sequences of octets, and whose range is the set of sequences of
characters from a character repertoire; that is, a sequence of octets
and a character encoding scheme determines a sequence of characters.

<tli>code position: An integer that determines a character, as per
some coded character set.

<tli>character repertoire: A finite set of characters. The range of a
coded character set.

<tli>coded character set: A function whose domain is a subset of the
integers and whose range is a character repertoire. That is, for some
set of integers (usually of the form {0, 1, 2, ..., N} ), a coded
character set and an integer in that set determine a
character. Conversely, a character and a character set determine the
character's code position (or, in rare cases, a few code positions).

<tli>conforming HTML user agent: A user agent that conforms to this
specification in its treatment of the Internet Media Type
<code>text/html; version=2.0</code>.

<tli>HTML document:

An SGML document conforming to this document type definition.

<tli>minimally conforming HTML user agent:

A user agent that conforms to this specification in its
treatment of the Internet Media Type "text/html; level=0;
version=2.0"

</tl>

<h2>Terms from Normative References

<p>The following terms are defined in the SGML[SGML],
HTTP[HTTP], and URI[URI] specifications.@@

<tl> <tli>document type definition (DTD): @@A DTD is a collection of
declarations (entity, element, attribute, link, map, etc.) in SGML
syntax that defines the components and structures available for a
class (type) of documents.

<tli>element: @@A component of the hierarchical structure defined by
the document type definition; it is identified in a document instance
by descriptive markup, usually a start-tag and an end- tag.

<tli>entity: data with an associated notation or interpretation; for
example, a sequence of octets associated with an Internet Media Type.

<tli>HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the primary
application-level protocol for the transfer of documents via the
World-Wide Web.

<tli>markup: Text added to the data of a document to represent its
structure. There are four different kinds of markup: descriptive
markup (tags), references, markup declarations, and processing
instructions.

<tli>MIME: The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [4] provide the
ability to transfer non-textual data, such as graphics, audio and fax,
via Internet mail.

<tli>message entity: a head and body. The head is a collection of
name/value fields, and the body is a sequence of octets. The head
defines the content type and content transfer encoding of the body.

<tli>SGML: Standard Generalized Markup Language [12] (see also [9] and
[6]) is a system for describing document types and markup languages to
represent them.

<tli>SGML document: A set of entities, including the document entity,
which is a text entity that conforms to the grammar specified in the
SGML standard.

<tli>tag: Markup that delimits an element. A tag includes a name which
refers to an element declaration in the DTD, and may include
attributes.

<tli>text entity: A finite sequence of characters. A text entity
typically takes the form of a sequence of octets with some associated
character encoding, transmitted over the network or stored in a file.

<tli>URI: A Universal Resource Identifier is a formatted string that
serves as an identifier for a resource, typcally on the Internet. URIs
are used in HTML to identify the destination of hypertext links, the
source of in-line images, and the object of form actions. URIs in
common use include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)[URL]
and Relative URLs[RELURL].

</tl>

<h2>Glossary

<p>These terms are used informally:

<tl>
<tli>user agent: A component of a distributed system that presents
an interface and processes requests on behalf of a user; for example,
a www browser or a mail user agent.

<tli>WWW: The World-Wide Web is a hypertext-based, distributed
information system created by researchers at CERN in
Switzerland. Users may create, edit or browse hypertext
documents. <code>http://www.w3.org/</>

<h2>Conformance

<emph>@@ this needs a LOT of work!</emph>

Version 2.0 of HTML introduces a distinction between levels of
conformance:

<tl>
<tli>Level 0: Indicates the minimum conformance level. When writing
Level 0 documents, authors can be confident that the rendering at
different sites will reflect their intent.

<tli>Level 1: Includes Level 0 features plus features such as
highlighting and images.

<tli>Level 2: Includes all Level 0 and Level 1 features, plus forms.

</tl>

<tl>
<tli>may:

The implementation is not obliged to follow this in any way.

<tli>must:

If this is not followed, the implementation does not conform to this
specification.

<tli>shall:

If this is not followed, the implementation does not conform to this
specification.

<tli>should:

If this is not followed, though the implementation officially conforms
to the specification, undesirable results may occur in practice.

<tli>typical:

Typical rendering is described for many elements. This is not a
mandatory part of the specification but is given as guidance for
designers and to help explain the uses for which the elements were
intended.
