<h1>Introduction

<h2>Purpose

The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language
used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform
to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics
that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
applications. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) global
information initiative since 1990. This specification corresponds to
the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994 and referred
to as "HTML 2.0".

This specification defines HTML as an application of ISO Standard
8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML provides a formal definition
of the HTML syntax in the form of a Document Type Definition (DTD).

This specification also defines HTML as an Internet Media
Type<liref refid=imedia> and MIME Content Type<liref refid=MIME> called
<code>"text/html"</>, or <code>"text/html; version=2.0"</>. As such, it
defines the semantics of the HTML syntax and how that syntax should be
interpreted by user agents.
