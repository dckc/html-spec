<H1>Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0 </H1>
<H3><A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT1" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(1)</A></H3>
<P>There are a number of syntactic idioms that are not supported or
are supported inconsistently in some historical user agent
implementations.  These idioms are identified in notes like this
throughout this specification.

HTML documents should not contain these idioms, at least until such
time as support for them is widely deployed.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT2" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(2)</A></H3>
<P>The document character set is somewhat independent of the
character encoding scheme used to represent a document.  For example,
the ISO-2022-JP character encoding scheme can be used for HTML
documents, since its repertoire is a subset of the ISO10646
repertoire.  The critical distinction is that numeric character
references agree with ISO10646 regardless of how the document is encoded.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT3" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(3)</A></H3>
<P>In the interest of robustness and extensibility, there are a number
of widely deployed conventions for handling non-conforming documents.
See section <A HREF="html-spec.html#SEC20" REL=XREF>Undeclared Markup Error Handling</A> for details.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT4" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(4)</A></H3>
<P>To support non-western writing systems, HTML user agents should
support ISO-10646-UCS-2 or similar character encoding schemes and as
much of the character repertoire of ISO10646 as is practical.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT5" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(5)</A></H3>
<P>There are SGML mechanisms, CDATA and RCDATA, to allow most <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> characters to be entered without the use of entity
references.  Because these features tend to be used and implemented
inconsistently, and because they conflict with techniques for reducing
HTML to 7 bit ASCII for transport, they are deprecated in this version
of HTML.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT6" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(6)</A></H3>
<P>The SGML declaration for HTML specifies SHORTTAG YES, which
means that there are other valid syntaxes for tags, such as NET tags,
<SAMP>`&#60;EM/.../'</SAMP>;  empty start tags, <SAMP>`&#60;&#62;'</SAMP>;  and empty
end-tags, <SAMP>`&#60;/&#62;'</SAMP>.  Until support for these idioms is widely
deployed, their use is strongly discouraged.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT7" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(7)</A></H3>
<P>Some historical implementations consider any occurrence
of the <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> character to signal the end of a tag.  For
compatibility with such implementations, when <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> appears in an
attribute value, it should be represented with a numeric
character reference.  For example,
<SAMP>`&#60;IMG SRC="eq1.jpg" alt="a&#62;b"&#62;'</SAMP> should be written
<SAMP>`&#60;IMG SRC="eq1.jpg" alt="a&#38;#62;b"&#62;'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`&#60;IMG SRC="eq1.jpg" alt="a&#38;gt;b"&#62;'</SAMP>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT8" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(8)</A></H3>
<P>Some historical implementations allow any character 
except space or <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> in a name token.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT9" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(9)</A></H3>
<P>Some historical implementations only understand the 
minimized syntax.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT10" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(10)</A></H3>
<P>Some historical HTML implementations incorrectly consider 
any <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> character to be the termination of a comment.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT11" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(11)</A></H3>
<P>If the body of a <SAMP>`text/html'</SAMP> message entity does not
begin with a document type declaration, an HTML user agent should
infer the above document type declaration.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT12" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(12)</A></H3>
<P>The length of a title is not limited;  however, long titles may
be truncated in some applications.  To minimize this possibility,
titles should be fewer than 64 characters.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT13" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT13" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(13)</A></H3>
<P>The <EM>META</EM> element should not be used where a specific
element such as <EM>TITLE</EM> would be appropriate.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT14" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT14" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(14)</A></H3>
<P>The method by which the server extracts document metainformation is
unspecified and not mandatory.  The META element
only provides an extensible mechanism for identifying and embedding
document metainformation - how it may be used is up to the individual
server implementation and the HTML user agent.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT15" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT15" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(15)</A></H3>
<P>References to the "beginning of a new line" do not imply that
the renderer is forbidden from using a constant left indent for
rendering preformatted text.  The left indent may be constrained by the
width required.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT16" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT16" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(16)</A></H3>
<P>Within a Preformatted Text element, the constraint that the
rendering must be on a fixed horizontal character pitch may limit or
prevent the ability of the HTML user agent to faithfully render
phrase markup.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT17" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT17" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(17)</A></H3>
<P>Some historical documents contain <EM>P</EM> tags in <EM>PRE</EM>
elements.  User agents are encouraged to treat this a a line break.  A
<EM>P</EM> tag followed by a newline character should produce only one
line break, not a line break plus a blank line.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT18" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT18" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(18)</A></H3>
<P>In a previous draft of the HTML specification, the syntax
of <EM>XMP</EM> and <EM>LISTING</EM> elements allowed closing tags to
be treated as data characters, as long as the tag name was not
<EM>XMP</EM> or <EM>LISTING</EM>, respectively.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT19" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT19" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(19)</A></H3>
<P>In a previous draft, HTML included a <EM>PLAINTEXT</EM> element that
is similar to the <EM>LISTING</EM> element, except that there is
no closing tag:  all characters after the <EM>PLAINTEXT</EM> start-tag
are data.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT20" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT20" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(20)</A></H3>
<P>User agents may support the <EM>DFN</EM> elmenent, not
included in this specification, as it has been deployed to some extent.
It is used to indicate the defining instance of a term, and it is
typically rendered in italic or bold italic.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT21" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT21" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(21)</A></H3>
<P>User agents may support some typographic elmenents not included in
this specification, as they have been deployed to some extent.  The
<EM>STRIKE</EM> element indicates horizontal line through the characters,
and the <EM>U</EM> element indicates an underline.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT22" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT22" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(22)</A></H3>
<P>Some HTML user agents can process graphics linked via anchors,
but not <EM>IMG</EM> graphics.  If a graphic is essential, it should be
referenced from an <EM>A</EM> element rather than in <EM>IMG</EM> element.  If
the graphic is not essential, then the <EM>IMG</EM> element is
appropriate.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT23" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT23" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(23)</A></H3>
<P>In practice, the media types of image resources are limited to a
few raster graphic formats:  typically <SAMP>`image/gif'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`image/jpeg'</SAMP>.  In particular, <SAMP>`text/html'</SAMP>
resources are not intended to be used as image resources.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT24" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT24" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(24)</A></H3>
<P>Use the non-breaking space and soft hyphen indicator characters is 
discouraged because support for them is not widely deployed.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT25" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT25" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(25)</A></H3>
<P>To support non-western writing systems, a larger character repertoire
will be specified in a future version of HTML.  The document character
set will be ISO/IEC 10646-1, or some subset that agrees with ISO/IEC
10646-1;  in particular, all numeric character references must use code
positions assigned by ISO/IEC 10646-1.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT26" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT26" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(26)</A></H3>
<P>The URI from a query form submission can be used in a normal
anchor style hyperlink.  Unfortunately, the use of the <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP>
character to separate form fields interacts with its use in SGML
attribute values as an entity reference delimiter.  For example, the
URI <SAMP>`http://host/?x=1&#38;y=2'</SAMP> must be written
<SAMP>`&#60;a href="http://host/?x=1&#38;#38;y=2"'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`&#60;a href="http://host/?x=1&#38;#amp;y=2"&#62;'</SAMP>.

HTTP server implementors, and in particular, CGI implementors are
encouraged to support the use of <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> in place of <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> to save
users the trouble of escaping <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> characters this way.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT27" HREF="html-spec.html#FOOT27" REL=FOOTNOTE-INV>(27)</A></H3>
<P>The URL encoding may result in very long URIs, which cause some
historical HTTP server implementations to exhibit defective behavior.
As a result, some HTML forms are written using <SAMP>`METHOD=POST'</SAMP> even
though the form submission has no side-effects.
