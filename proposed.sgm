<h2>Proposed Features

<p>This section describes proposed HTML elements and entities that are
not currently supported under HTML Levels 0, 1, or 2@@, but may be
supported in the future.

<h3>Additional Character Entities

<p>To indicate special characters, HTML uses entity or numeric
representations. Additional character presentations are proposed:

<listing><![CDATA[
CHARACTER			REPRESENTATION

Non-breaking space		&nbsp;

Soft-hyphen			&shy;

Registered			&reg;

Copyright			&copy;
]]></listing>

<h3>Defining Instance Element

<![CDATA[
<DFN> ... </DFN>
]]>

<p>The Defining Instance element indicates the defining instance of a
term. The typical rendering is bold or bold italic. This element is
not widely supported.

<h3>Strike Element

<![CDATA[
<STRIKE> ... </STRIKE>
]]>

<p>The Strike element is proposed to indicate strikethrough, a font
style in which a horizontal line appears through characters. This
element is not widely supported.

<h3>Underline Element

<![CDATA[
<U> ... </U>
]]>

<p>The Underline element is proposed to indicate that the text should
be rendered as underlined. This proposed tag is not supported by all
HTML interpreters.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
The text <U>shown here</U> is rendered in the 
document as underlined.
]]></listing>
