<h1>Acknowledgments

<p>The HTML document type was designed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN as
part of the 1990 World Wide Web project. In 1992, Dan Connolly wrote
the HTML Document Type Definition (DTD) and a brief HTML
specification.

<p>Since 1993, a wide variety of Internet participants have
contributed to the evolution of HTML, which has included the addition
of in-line images introduced by the NCSA Mosaic software for WWW. Dave
Raggett played an important role in deriving the FORMS material from
the HTML+ specification.

<p>Dan Connolly and Karen Olson Muldrow rewrote the HTML Specification
in 1994. The document was then edited by the HTML working group as a
whole, with updates being made by Eric Schieler, Mike Knezovich, and
Eric W. Sink at Spyglass, Inc. Finally, Roy Fielding restructured the
entire draft into its current form.
