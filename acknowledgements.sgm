<h1>Acknowledgments

<p>The HTML document type was designed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN as
part of the 1990 World Wide Web project. In 1992, Dan Connolly wrote
the HTML Document Type Definition (DTD) and a brief HTML
specification.

<p>Since 1993, a wide variety of Internet participants have
contributed to the evolution of HTML, which has included the addition
of in-line images introduced by the NCSA Mosaic software for WWW. Dave
Raggett played an important role in deriving the FORMS material from
the HTML+ specification.

<p>Dan Connolly and Karen Olson Muldrow rewrote the HTML Specification
in 1994. The document was then edited by the HTML working group as a
whole, with updates being made by Eric Schieler, Mike Knezovich, and
Eric W. Sink at Spyglass, Inc. Finally, Roy Fielding restructured the
entire draft into its current form.

<p>Special thanks to the many active participants in the HTML working
group, too numerous to list individually, without whom there would be
no standards process and no standard.  That this document approaches
its objective of carefully converging a description of current
practice and formalization of HTML's relationship to SGML is a tribute
to their effort.
