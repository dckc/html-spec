<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p> The term <em>character set</em> is often used to describe a ditigal
representation of text. ASCII is perhaps the most widely deployed
representation of text, and in the interest of interoperability,
information systems on the Internet traditionally rely on it
exclusively .

<p> The Multipurpose Mail Extensions (MIME) introduce Internet Media
Types, including text representations besides ASCII. The Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) used in the World-Wide Web is a proposed
Internet Media Type. But HTML is also an application of Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML).

<p> In the MIME and SGML specifications, the discussion of characters
representation is notoriously complex, and apparently subtly
inconsistent or incompatible. This document presents a collection of
terms intended to reconcile the two specifications, and serve as a
basis for rigorous discussion of characters and their digital
representations.


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The term <em>character set</em> is often used to describe a ditigal
representation of text. The specifications of such a representation
typically involves identifying a sufficiently expressive collection of
characters, and giving each of them a number.

<p> In conventional mathematics terminology then, a "character set"
is not just a set of characters, but a <em>function</em> whose domain
is a set of integers, and whose range is a set of characters.

<p> It seems that some standards documents, including the SGML
standard, go to great lengths to avoid such conventional mathematical
terms as function, domain and range. Perhaps the authors of those
documents intend the documents to be comprehensible without a prior
understanding of mathematics. But the expectation that notions such as
the conformance of an SGML document or SGML system can be understood
without an understanding of basic logic and mathematics seems absurd.

<p> And as we demonstrate below, these notions can be captured in the
terminology of Zermelo-Frankel set theory, a small, simple portion of
mathematics that is several hundred years old (if not thousands),
extremely widely understood, and used as the underpinnings of most of
mathematics and computer science.

<p> The terms <em>set</em>, <em>element</em>, <em>union</em>, and
<em>intersection</em> are introduced to students as young as five
years of age. The notions of proof, axioms, rules of inference, and
theorems, are taught in introductory geometry and rhetoric classes.

<p> In his text on Calculus<a href="#Spivak">[Spivak]</a>, Michael
Spivak writes:

<blockquote>

<p> Every aspect of this book was influenced by the desire to present
calculus not merely as a prelude to but as the first real encounter
with mathematics. Since the foundation of analysis provided the arena
in which modern modes of mathematical thinking developed, calculus
ought to be the place in which to expect, rather than avoid, the
strengthening of insight with logic. In addition to developing the
students' intuition about the beautiful concepts of analysis, it is
surely equally important to persuade them that precision and rigor are
neither deterrents to intuition, nor ends in themselves, but the
natural medium in which to formulate and think about mathematical
questions.

</blockquote>

<p> This document is not intended as the first real encounter with
mathematics. But neither will we make any effort to avoid or apologize
for mathematical terminology. The reader is referred to the large body
of literature on logic and set theory, including Douglas Hofstadter's
fascinating book<a href="#GEB">[GEB]</a>.

<h2>Coded Character Sets</h2>

<p> Calling such a function a character set, rather than something
such as <em>character table</em> or even <em>character sequence</em>
(as the domain of the function is often of the form {0, 1, 2, ..., N})
is unfortunate, but it is water under the bridge, and a lot of it by
now.

<p> Rather than attempting to divert all that water at this point, we
give a formal definition to the term <em>coded character set</em> from
[ISO10646] and other standards, along with the primitive notion of
character:

<dl>

<dt> character

<dd> An atom of information; for example, a letter or a digit.

<dt> coded character set

<dd> A function whose domain is a subset of the integers, and whose
range is a set of characters.

</dl>

<p> It might seem more intuitive to map from characters to integers,
rather than the way it is defined here. But in practice there are
some coded character sets that assign two different numbers to the
same character<a href="lee">[Lee]</a>, and so the inverse is not a
function in the general case.

<p> There are two other standard terms [ISO10646] that we define as
corollaries to the first two:

<dl>

<dt> code position

<dd> An integer that maps to a character via some coded character set.

<dt> character repertoire

<dd> A set of characters; that is, the range of a coded character set.

</dl>

<h2>Character Encodings</h2>

<p> The only practical means for exchanging information on the
Internet is to represent it as a sequence of octets (bytes). In the
case of a "single byte" coded character set, that is, an invertible
function <i>s</i> whose domain is {0, 1, 2, ..., <i>N</i>} for
<i>N</i> < 256, there is an obvious straightforward representation,
wherein each octet is mapped to a character via <i>s</i>:

<pre>
	encode (e) = e
              s

                                -1
	encode (char . rest) = s  (char) . repr(rest)
              s
</pre>

<p> But in the general case, the code position of a character may be
greater than 255. The natural extension of the above is the "double
byte" coded character set <i>d</i> and the following representation:

<pre>
                           -1                    -1
  encode (char . rest) = (d  (char) div 256) . (d  (char) mod 256) . repr(rest)
        d
</pre>

<p> But in practice, the general case is more comples. One popular
optimization for the common case of code positions below 128 is to
reserve bit 7 of the first octet that represents a character as a flag
bit, and omit the zero byte if it is clear. Escape sequences are
another populare optimization. The representation of a sequence of
characters is not generally as simple as representing each character
as some octets and concatenating them.

<p> In fact, the mapping from a sequence of octets to a sequence of
characters is often something we want to name and refer to. So we define:

<dl>

<dt>octet

<dd>an element of the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 255}

<dt>character encoding

<dd>a function whose range is the set of sequences of octets, and
whose range is the set of sequences of characters over some character
repertoire.

</dl>

<p> Note that for some encodings, a single sequence of characters may
have more than one representation, i.e. it inverse of the function is
not necessarily unique. But for every sequence of characters over the
repertoire, some representation as a sequence of octets is guaranteed
to exist.

<h2> MIME Charset vs. SGML Document Character Set</h2>

<p> In this terminology, the <tt>charset</tt> parameter on text/*
Internet Media Types refers to a character encoding, whereas an SGML
document character set names a coded character set.

<p> To discuss the representation of an SGML document using MIME, we
define the following terms:

<dl>

<dt>text entity

<dd>a sequence of characters

<dt>message entity

<dd>a sequence of octets with an associated Internet Media Type

</dl>

<p> A message entity of type <tt>text/*</tt> is equivalent to a text
entity: the <tt>charset</tt> parameter of the Internet Media Type
refers to a character encoding, which maps the octets of the message
enitity to a sequence of characters, i.e. a text entity.

<p> An SGML document is a set of entities, one of which is a text
entity called the document entity. The document entity includes an
SGML declaration, which indicates the document character set[sic],
among other things.

<p> In simple cases, where the document character set is ISO-646-IRV
(aka ASCII) and the document is just the document entity, the document
can be represented as a message entity by mapping the characters to
octets directly. The <tt>US-ASCII</tt> character encoding can be
defined in terms of the ISO-646-IRV coded character set:

<pre>
 decode        (octet . rest) = ASCII(octet) . decode        (rest)
       US-ASCII                                      US-ASCII
</pre>

<p> But the US-ASCII character encoding is actually sufficient to
represent all SGML documents (except those rare documents that use
characters outside the repertiore of ISO-646-IRV for markup).

<p> Suppose we have an SGML document D whose document character set is
the coded character set ISO10646. We find the document entity DE in
the form of sequence of octets OS in a disk file, encoded using the
Unicode-UCS-2 character encoding.

<pre>
	decode             (OS) = DE
	      Unicode-UCS-2
</pre>

<p> We can reduce the character repertoire necessary to represent the
document entity by replacing characters outside the ISO-646-IRV
character repertoire with numeric character references:

<pre>
	DE' = reduce(DE, ISO10646, ISO-646-IRV)

where

  reduce : SEQ(char) X Coded Character Set X Character Repertoire -> SEQ(char)

and

  reduce(c . rest, CCS, R) = if c in R, c . reduce(rest, CCS, R)
					else &#N; . reduce(rest, CCS, R)
					where CCS(N) = c
</pre>

<p> The resulting entity, DE' can then be endoded using US-ASCII


	decode        (OS') = DE' = reduce(DE, ISO10646, ISO-646-IRV)
              US-ASCII

<p> Hence, we can represent the document D as a message entity whose
content type is "text/plain; charset=US-ASCII" and whose body is OS'.


<p> <em>@@ more on why mixing character encodings and coded character
sets arbitrarily (given their repertoires intersect appropriately) may
be possible, but in practice it's not a good idea: a convention for
mapping character encodings to coded character sets should be
deployed.</em>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>


<p> The idea for the title of this document actually came from John
Klensin. The notion of character encoding was inspired by the MIME
specification by Ned Freed. James Clark, Ed Levinson, and several
other members of the MIMESGML working group collaborated in
discussions leading up to this draft. Liam Quin (sp?) from SoftQuad
and Gavin Nicol from EBT have provided guidance on these issues in
the past. Erik Naggum has provided invaluable aid in understanding the
SGML standard.
