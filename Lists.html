<H2><A
NAME="z32">Glossaries</A></H2><P>A glossary (or definition list) is
a list of paragraphs each of which
has a short title alongside it. Apart
from glossaries, this element is
useful for presenting a set of named
elements to the reader. The elements
within a glossary follow are introduced
by these elements:
<DL>
<DT>DT
<DD> The "term", typically placed in
a wide left indent
<DT>DD
<DD> The "definition", which may wrap
onto many lines
</DL>
<P>These elements must appear in pairs.
 Single occurrences of DT without
a following DD are allowed, and have
the same significance as if the DD
had been present with no text.. 
The one attribute which DL can take
is
<DL>
<DT>COMPACT
<DD> suggests that a compact rendering
be used, because the enclosed elements
are individually small, or the whole
glossary is rather large, or both.
</DL>

<H3>Typical rendering</H3><P>The definition list DT, DD pairs
are arranged vertically.   For each
pair, the DT element is on the left,
in a column of about a third of the
display area, and the DD element
is in the right hand two thirds of
the display area.  The DT term is
normally small enough to fit on one
line within the left-hand column.
If it is longer, it will either extend
across the page, in which case the
DD section is moved down to separate
them, or it is wrapped onto successive
lines of the left hand column.<P>
This is sometimes implemented with
the use of a large negative first
line indent.<P>
White space is typically left between
successive DT,DD pairs unless the
COMPACT attribute is given.  The
COMPACT attribute is appropriate
for lists which are long and/or have
DT,DD pairs which each take only
a line or two.  It is of course possible
for the rendering software to discover
these cases itself and make its own
decisions, and this is to be encouraged.<P>
The COMPACT attribute may also reduce
the width of the left-hand (DT) column.
<H3>Examples of use</H3>
<PRE>	&lt;DL>
	&lt;DT>Term the first&lt;DD>definition paragraph is reasonably
	long but is still displayed clearly
	&lt;DT>Term2 follows&lt;DD>Definition of term2
	&lt;/DL>

	&lt;DL COMPACT>
	&lt;DT>Term&lt;DD>definition paragraph
	&lt;DT>Term2&lt;DD>Definition of term2
	&lt;/DL>




</PRE>
<H2>Lists</H2><P>A list is a sequence of paragraphs,
each of which may be preceded by
a special mark or sequence number.
The syntax is:
<PRE>
		&lt;UL>
		&lt;LI> list element
		&lt;LI> another list element ...
		&lt;/UL>

</PRE><P>The opening list tag  may be any
of UL, OL, MENU or DIR.  It must
be immediately followed by the first
list element. 
<H3>Typical rendering</H3><P>The representation of the list is
not defined here, but a bulleted
list for unordered lists,  and a
sequence of numbered paragraphs for
an ordered list would be quite appropriate.
Other possibilities for interactive
display include embedded scrollable
browse panels.<P>
List elements with typical rendering
are:
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME="z35">UL</A>
<DD> A list of multi-line paragraphs,
typically separated by some white
space and/or marked by bullets, etc.
<DT><A
NAME="z41">OL</A>
<DD> As UL, but the paragraphs are
typically numbered in some way to
indicate the order as significant.
<DT><A
NAME="z36">MENU</A>
<DD> A list of smaller paragraphs.
Typically one line per item, with
a style more compact than UL.
<DT><A
NAME="z40">DIR</A>
<DD> A list of short elements, typically
less than 20 characters.  These may
be arranged in columns across the
page, typically 24 character in width.
If the rendering software is able
to optimize the column width as function
of the widths of individual elements,
so much the better.
</DL>

<H3>Example of use</H3>
<PRE>		<A
NAME="z34" HREF="HTML.dtd.html#z30">&lt;OL></A>
		<A
NAME="z33" HREF="HTML.dtd.html#z27">&lt;LI></A> When you get to the station, leave
		by the southern exit, on platform one.
		&lt;LI>Turn left to face toward the mountain
		&lt;LI>Walk for a mile or so until you reach the
		"Asquith Arms" then 
		&lt;LI>Wait and see...
		&lt;/OL>

		&lt;<A
NAME="z38" HREF="HTML.dtd.html#z29"> MENU</A> >
		&lt;LI>The oranges should be pressed fresh
		&lt;LI>The nuts may come from a packet
		&lt;LI>The gin must be good quality
		&lt;/MENU>

		&lt;<A
NAME="z39" HREF="HTML.dtd.html#z31"> DIR</A> >
		&lt;LI>A-H&lt;LI>I-M
		&lt;LI>M-R&lt;LI>S-Z
		&lt;/DIR>
