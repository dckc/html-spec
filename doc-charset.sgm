<h1>Data Characters

<p>The characters between HTML tags represent text. An HTML document
(including tags and text) is encoded using the coded character set
specified by the "charset" parameter of the "text/html" media type.
For levels defined in this specification, the "charset" parameter is
restricted to US-ASCII<liref refid=US-ASCII> or ISO-8859-1<liref
refid=ISO-8859-1>. ISO-8859-1 encodes a set of characters known as
Latin Alphabet No. 1, or simply Latin-1.  Latin-1 includes characters
from most Western European languages, as well as a number of control
characters.  Latin-1 also includes a non-breaking space, a soft hyphen
indicator, 93 graphical characters, 8 unassigned characters, and 25
control characters.

<p>Use the non-breaking space and soft hyphen indicator characters is
discouraged because they are not recognized and interpreted by all
HTML interpreters.

<p>Because certain characters will be interpreted as markup, they must
be represented by entity references. HTML provides character entity
references to facilitate the entry and interpretation of characters by
name or by numerical position (octet).

<h2>Special Characters

<p>Certain data characters have special meaning in HTML
documents. There are two printing characters which may be interpreted
by an HTML application to have an effect of the format of the text:

<tl>
<tli>Space:
<ul>
<li>Interpreted as a word space (place where a line can be
broken) in all contexts except the Preformatted Text element.

<li>Interpreted as a nonbreaking space within the Preformatted Text element.
</ul>

<tli>Hyphen:
<ul>
<li>Iterpreted as a hyphen glyph in all contexts
<li>Interpreted as a potential word space by hyphenation engine
</ul>
</tl>

<h2>Control Characters

<p>Control characters are non-printable characters that are typically
used for communication and device control, as format effectors, and as
information separators. There are 58 character positions occupied by
control characters.

<p>In SGML applications, the use of control characters is limited in
order to maximize the chance of successful interchange over
heterogenous networks and operating systems. In HTML, only three
control characters are used: Horizontal Tab (HT, encoded as 9 decimal
in US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1), Carriage Return, and Line Feed.

<p>Horizontal Tab is interpreted as a word space in all contexts
except preformatted text.  Within preformatted text, the tab should be
interpreted to shift the horizontal column position to the next
position which is a multiple of 8 on the same line; that is, col :=
(col+8) mod 8.

<p>Carriage Return and Line Feed are conventionally used to represent
end of line. For Internet Media Types defined as "text/*", the
sequence CR LF is used to represent an end of line. In practice,
text/html documents are frequently represented and transmitted using
an end of line convention that depends on the conventions of the
source of the document; frequently, that representation consists of CR
only, LF only, or CR LF combination. In HTML, end of line in any of
its variations is interpreted as a word space in all contexts except
preformatted text.  Within preformatted text, HTML interpreters should
expect to treat any of the three common representations of end-of-line
as starting a new line.

<h2>Character Entities

<p>Two reasons for using a character entity reference:

<ul>
<li>the keyboard does not provide a key for the character, such as on
U.S. keyboards which do not provide European characters

<li>the character may be interpreted as SGML coding, such as the
ampersand (&), double quotes ("), the lesser (<) and greater (>)
characters
</ul>


<p>A character entity is represented in an HTML document as an SGML
entity whose name is defined in the HTML DTD.

<h3>Character Name References

<p>Most of the Latin alphabet No. 1 set of printing characters may be
represented within the text of an HTML document by a character
entity. See <hdref refid=iso-latin-1>@@ for a list of the characters,
names, input syntax, and descriptions for numeric and special graphic
characters. See <hdref refid=entity-sets> for the SGML entity
definitions of "Added Latin 1 for HTML".

<h3>Character Octet References

<p>It is possible to explicitly reference the printing characters of
the ISO-8859-1 character encoding using a character octet
reference. See <hdref refid=entity-sets> for a list of the characters,
their names and input syntax.

<p>Character octet references are represented in an HTML document as
SGML entities whose name is number sign (#) followed by a numeral from
32-126 and 161-255. The HTML DTD includes a numeric character for each
of the printing characters of the ISO-8859-1 encoding, so that one may
reference them by number if it is inconvenient to enter them directly.

<p>The character octet references are not dependent on the character
set encoding of the document. For example, "&#215;" always represents
the ISO-8859-1 multiply sign, even when the document's declared
character set is other than ISO-8859-1.
