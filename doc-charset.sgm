<h1 id=datachrs>Character Content

An HTML user agent should present the body of an HTML document as
a collection of typeset paragraphs and preformatted text. Except
for the <tag/PRE/ element, each block structuring element is regarded as
a paragraph by taking the data characters in its content and the
content of its descendant elements, concatenating them, and
splitting the result into words, separated by space, tab, or
record end characters (and perhaps hyphen characters). The
sequence of words is typeset as a paragraph by breaking it into
lines.

<h2>The ISO Latin 1 Character Repertoire

Conforming HTML user agents are required to support the [US-ASCII] and
[ISO-8859-1] character encodings, and the Latin Alphabet Nr. 1
document character set as specified in <hdref refid=decl>.

The character repertoire shared by the two encodings and the document
character set is Latin Alphabet Nr. 1, or simply Latin-1.  Latin-1
includes characters from most Western European languages, as well as a
number of control characters.  Latin-1 also includes a non-breaking
space, a soft hyphen indicator, 93 graphical characters, 8 unassigned
characters, and 25 control characters.

<note>Use the non-breaking space and soft hyphen indicator characters is 
discouraged because support for them is not widely deployed.
</note>

In SGML applications, the use of control characters is limited in 
order to maximize the chance of successful interchange over 
heterogeneous networks and operating systems. In HTML, only three 
control characters are allowed: Horizontal Tab (HT, encoded as 9 
decimal in US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1), Carriage Return, and Line Feed.

The HTML DTD references the Added Latin 1 entity set, to allow
mnemonic representation of Latin 1 characters using only the widely
supported ASCII character repertoire. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
Kurt G&ouml;del was a famous logician and mathematician.
]]></listing>

See <hdref refid="lat1ent"> for a table of the "Added Latin 1" entities,
and <hdref refid="iso-latin-1"> for a table of the code positionss of
ISO-8859-1.
