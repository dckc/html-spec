<h1 id=datachrs>Character Content

An HTML user agent should present the body of an HTML document as
a collection of typeset paragraphs and preformatted text. Except
for the <tag/PRE/ element, each block structuring element is regarded as
a paragraph by taking the data characters in its content and the
content of its descendant elements, concatenating them, and
splitting the result into words, separated by space, tab, or
record end characters (and perhaps hyphen characters). The
sequence of words is typeset as a paragraph by breaking it into
lines.

<h2 id=charlist>The ISO Latin 1 Character Repertoire

The minimum character repertoire supported by all conforming HTML user
agents is Latin Alphabet Nr. 1, or simply Latin-1.  Latin-1 includes
characters from most Western European languages, as well as a number
of control characters.  Latin-1 also includes a non-breaking space, a
soft hyphen indicator, 93 graphical characters, 8 unassigned
characters, and 25 control characters.
<note>Use the non-breaking space and soft hyphen indicator characters is 
discouraged because support for them is not widely deployed.
</note>
<note>
To support non-western writing systems, a larger character repertoire
will be specified in a future version of HTML. The document character
set will be ISO/IEC 10646-1, or some subset that agrees with ISO/IEC
10646-1; in particular, all numeric character references must use code
positions assigned by ISO/IEC 10646-1.
</note>

In SGML applications, the use of control characters is limited in
order to maximize the chance of successful interchange over
heterogeneous networks and operating systems. In HTML, only three
control characters are allowed: Horizontal Tab (HT, encoded as 9
decimal in <code/US-ASCII/ and <code/ISO-8859-1/), Carriage Return,
and Line Feed.

The HTML DTD references the Added Latin 1 entity set, to allow
mnemonic representation of Latin 1 characters using only the widely
supported ASCII character repertoire. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
Kurt G&ouml;del was a famous logician and mathematician.
]]></listing>

See <hdref refid="lat1ent"> for a table of the "Added Latin 1" entities,
and <hdref refid="iso-latin-1"> for a table of the code positions of
ANSI/ISO 8859-1.
