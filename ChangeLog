 o Integrated ICADD SDA attributes and APPINFO (Thanks
   to Jeff Suttor)
 o Updated catalog etc. with new FPIs (formal public
   identifiers).
   Old format: "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN//2.0"
   New format: "-//IETF//DTD 2.0 HTML//EN"
 o Changed FUNCTION character syntax: uncommented the
   real one, commented out the hack version.
 o Added FPI's and public text for "Strict" versions of the
   DTD (e.g. "-//IETF//DTD HTML Strict Level
   1//EN" maps to html-1s.dtd)
 o Changed FPI used to reference ISO latin 1 entities.
 o Changed a bunch of + occurence indicators to * for clarity
 o Changed some parameter entities to comply with SGML
   tokenization rules.

revision 1.12
date: 1994/05/17 21:07:53;  author: connolly;  state: Exp;  lines: +65 -45
ISOlat1: changed entities from text entities (which get parsed
redundantly) to CDATA entities, which matches the semantics
of the implementation I'm developing.

README.html:
Removed references to doctype-mosaic.
Changed public identifier to reference no particular version of the
DTD (sneaky...)

Added links to a few interesting things.


html.decl:

removed "255 1 UNUSED" stuff, as per somebody's suggestion...
WEK or somebody... can't exactly remember.

Added comment about RE vs SEPCHAR stuff...


html.dtd:

* Added comments in the HTML.Prescriptive marked section
  moved bogus second public identifier to another file...

* Removed bogus isindexatend, HTML.GO, HTML.aEndOmissable stuff

* added bodyBlockOnly feature test

* changed KEY, U to feature-test-controlled elements

* added a @@ note about relative HREF's

* changed BASE HREF attr to be required

* changed amp, lt, etc. entities to be CDATA entities,
so they don't get parsed at runtime.

* moved obsolete elements after forms


optional.html:
updated w.r.t KEY, U
----------------------------
revision 1.11
date: 1994/04/30 03:17:56;  author: connolly;  state: Exp;  lines: +32 -13
Makefile:
* doctype-mosaic.sgml is obsolete: The "default" version of
the DTD parses everything now... (after a few tweaks here and there)

html.dtd:
* Changed BODY to allow %htext, making <P> start tags not necessary,
but keeping <P> as a container. This means I don't really need
a separate mosaid mode any more.

* Moved several of the features that are incompatible with extant
docs under a %HTML.Prescriptive feature set.

* Added HTML.Version entity, for use by code generation tools.
This entity varies according to the feature set used.

* Changed the "default" mode of some features:
+<!ENTITY % HTML.anchorNameCDATA "INCLUDE"
+<!ENTITY % HTML.PLAINTEXT "INCLUDE"
+<!ENTITY % HTML.font-phrase "INCLUDE"

* Changed several attribute names to coincide with their
values, for a hacked version of attribute minimization
support in libwww.

* Added %block to ADDRESS content


* Added a #DEFAULT entity so that undefined entities are legal
(Hmmm...)

revision 1.9
date: 1994/04/14 01:23:26;  author: connolly;  state: Exp;  lines: +31 -10
After testing a few more files, inc. some from ORA GNN.

Added a few new feature test entities:
> 	-- The GO element used in ORA GNN. What is this??? -->
>
> <!ENTITY % HTML.aEndOmissable "IGNORE"
> 	-- infer </A> tags, as in ORA GNN stuff -->
>
> <!ENTITY % HTML.isindexAtEnd "IGNORE"
> 	-- allow ISINDEX after HEAD and BODY, as in ORA GNN stuff -->

NEXTID is "on" by default -- it doesn't hurt anything, I guess.

ISINDEX is allowed in %body-content if HTML.forms is "on"
@@ Hmmm... this means one must search the whole doc, not just
the head, to see if it's an index. Bad.

Expanded the BLOCKQUOTE content model to include all sorts
of %block stuff -- not just P and ADDRESS.

Fixed missing * in FORM content model.
----------------------------
revision 1.8
date: 1994/04/09 01:02:10;  author: connolly;  state: Exp;  lines: +275 -128
* Added feature test entities for stuff that's handled different ways
by different HTML implementations or specifications.

* Removed %headelement, %bodyelement, %oldstyle, in favor of
using OMITTAG to infer <HEAD>, <BODY> tags.

* Changed %URL to %URI, and cited specification

* Revamped %linkattributes in light of feature test entities

* Revamped HTML, HEAD, elements in light of feature test entities

* Anchor names may or may not be ID's based on the HTML.anchorNameID
feature-test entity.

* Changed %inline to be composed of %phrase and %font, where
%font is controlled by %HTML.font-phrase

* Changed EM, CODE, SAMP, etc. from (#PCDATA) to (%htext)+

* Added P, BR to %text

* replaced %stext with %block and %htext

* Changed BODY, A content models.

* Added BR element

* Changed DL content model to (DT*, DD?)+, changed DT, DD from EMPTY
to containers with omissable end tags. This match all the cases I
found during testing.

* Changed OL, UL, etc. similarly

* Replaced ISO latin 1 entity declarations with an entity reference

* Added FORMs

* Removed emacs local-variable cruft

revision 1.7
date: 1994/04/01 19:21:25;  author: connolly;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -98
branches:  1.7.2;
Extracted the DTD from the <!SGML .. ><!DOCTYPE [ ...DTD... ]>
stuff, and put the SGML declaration in a separate file.

The DTD can now be used in the more traditional:

	<!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "html.dtd">
	<title>
	<h1>
	...

style.

Changed P, LI, DT, DD from EMPTY to containers.

Changed BODY, DL, etc. to have ELEMENT content.

Changed lists to allow embeded lists.

Removed NEXTID element -- should be a processing instruction.

Note: The BR feature should be represented as an entity &br;
that expands to a processing instruction <? break line>
rather than an element <br>.

The PRE style newline handling should be a different
NOTATION.

Changed content model of %inline elements to inlcude A.

Changed content model of A to ANY.

B, I, U, TT only allowed inside PRE. EM, STRONG, etc.
not allowed inside PRE.

ISOLat1 stuff moved to separate file.

removed emacs local variables.
