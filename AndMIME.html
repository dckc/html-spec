<H1>HTML and MIME</H1>

<P>The definition of the HTML content subtype is

<DL>

<DT>MIME Type name

<DD>text

<DT>MIME subtype name:

<DD>html

<DT>Required parameters:

<DD>none

<DT>Optional parameters:

<DD>charset
</DL>

<H2>Character sets</H2>

<P>The base character set (the SGML BASESET) for HTML is ISO
Latin-1. This is the set referred to by any numeric <A
HREF="Text.html#z4" NAME="z3">character references</A> .
The actual character set used in the representation of an HTML
document may be ISO Latin 1, or its 7-bit subset which is ASCII.
There is no obligation for an HTML document to contain any characters
above decimal 127. It is possible that a transport medium such
as electronic mail imposes constraints on the number of bits
in a representation of a document, though the HTTP access protocol
used by W3 always allows 8 bit transfer.

<P>When an HTML document is encoded using 7-bit characters,
then the mechanisms of <A HREF="Text.html#z4"
NAME="z1">character references</A> and <A
HREF="Text.html#z5" NAME="z2">entity references</A> may be used
to encode characters in the upper half of the ISO Latin-1 set.
In this way, documents may be prepared which are suitable for
mailing through 7-bit limited systems.
