These elements allow sections of
text to be formatted in a particular
way, to provide emphasis, etc.  The
tags do NOT cause a paragraph break,
and may be used on sections of text
within paragraphs.<P>
Where not supported by implementations,
like all tags, these tags should
be ignored but the content rendered.<P>
All these tags have related closing
tags, as in
<PRE>		This is &lt;EM>emphasized&lt;/EM> text.

</PRE><P>Some of these styles are more explicit
than others about how they should
be physically represented.  The logical
styles should be used wherever possible,
unless for example it is necessary
to refer to the formatting in the
text. (Eg, "The italic parts are
mandatory".)
<H3>Note:</H3><P>Browsers unable to display a specified
style may render it in some alternative,
or the default, style, with some
loss of quality for the reader. Some
implementations may ignore these
tags altogether, so information providers
should attempt not to rely on them
as essential to the information content.<P>
These element names are derived from
TeXInfo macro names.

<H2>Examples of use</H2>
<PRE>	This text contains an &lt;em>emphasized&lt;/em> word.
	&lt;strong>Don't assume&lt;/strong> that it will be italic!
	It was made using the &lt;CODE>EM&lt;/CODE> element. A citation is
	typically italic and has no formal necessary structure:
	&lt;cite>Moby Dick&lt;/cite> is a book title.
