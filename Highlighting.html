<H1>Character highlighting</H1>

<P>Status: <A HREF="StatusMeanings.html#z5"
NAME="z3">Extra</A>

<P>These elements allow sections of text to be formatted in a
particular way, to provide emphasis, etc.
The tags do NOT cause a paragraph break,
and may be used on sections of text within paragraphs.

<P>Where not supported by implementations,
like all tags, these tags should be ignored but the content rendered.

<P>All these tags have related closing tags,
as in

<PRE>		This is &#60;EM&#62;emphasized&#60;/EM&#62; text.

</PRE>

<P>Some of these styles are more explicit than others about how
they should be physically represented. The logical styles should
be used wherever possible, unless for example it is necessary
to refer to the formatting in the text. (Eg,
"The italic parts are mandatory".)

<H3>Note:</H3>

<P>Browsers unable to display a specified style may render it
in some alternative, or the default, style,
with some loss of quality for the reader.
Some implementations may ignore these tags altogether,
so information providers should attempt not to rely on them as
essential to the information content.

<P>These element names are derived from TeXInfo macro names.

<H2>Examples of use</H2>

<PRE>	This text contains an &#60;em&#62;emphasized&#60;/em&#62; word.
	&#60;strong&#62;Don't assume&#60;/strong&#62; that it will be italic!
	It was made using the &#60;CODE&#62;EM&#60;/CODE&#62; element. A citation is
	typically italic and has no formal necessary structure:
	&#60;cite&#62;Moby Dick&#60;/cite&#62; is a book title.
