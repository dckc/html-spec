<h1>Block Structuring Elements

<p>The following elements may be included in the body of an HTML document:

<h2>Paragraph

<![CDATA[
<P> ... </P>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Paragraph element indicates a paragraph. The exact indentation,
leading space, etc. of a paragraph is not defined and may be a
function of other tags, style sheets, etc.

<p>Typically, paragraphs are surrounded by a vertical space of one
line or half a line. This is typically not the case within the Address
element and is never the case within the Preformatted Text
element. With some HTML interpreters, the first line in a paragraph is
indented.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<H1>This Heading Precedes the Paragraph</H1>
<P>This is the text of the first paragraph.
<P>This is the text of the second paragraph. Although you do not 
need to start paragraphs on new lines, maintaining this 
convention facilitates document maintenance.</P>
<P>This is the text of a third paragraph.</P>
]]></listing>

<h2>Preformatted Text

<![CDATA[
<PRE> ... </PRE>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Preformatted Text element presents blocks of text in
fixed-width font, and so is suitable for text that has been formatted
on screen.

<p>The &lt;PRE> tag may be used with the optional WIDTH attribute. The
WIDTH attribute specifies the maximum number of characters for a line
and allows the HTML interpreter to select a suitable font and
indentation. If the WIDTH attribute is not present, a width of 80
characters is assumed. Where the WIDTH attribute is supported, widths
of 40, 80 and 132 characters should be presented optimally, with other
widths being rounded up.

<p>Within preformatted text:

<ul>
<li>Line breaks within the text are rendered as a move to the
beginning of the next line.

<li>The &lt;P> tag should not be used@@. If found, it should be rendered
as a move to the beginning of the next line.

<li>Anchor elements and character highlighting elements may be used.

<li>Elements that define paragraph formatting (headings, address,
etc.) must not be used.

<li>The horizontal tab character (encoded in US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1
as decimal 9) must be interpreted as the smallest positive nonzero
number of spaces which will leave the number of characters so far on
the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not recommended however.
</ul>

<NOTE>References to the "beginning of a new line" do not imply that
the renderer is forbidden from using a constant left indent for
rendering preformatted text. The left indent may be constrained by the
width required.  </note>

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<PRE WIDTH="80">
This is an example line.
</PRE>
]]></listing>

<NOTE>Within a Preformatted Text element, the constraint that the
rendering must be on a fixed horizontal character pitch may limit or
prevent the ability of the HTML interpreter to faithfully render
character formatting elements.
</note>

<h2>Address

<![CDATA[
<ADDRESS> ... </ADDRESS>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Address element specifies such information as address,
signature and authorship, often at the top or bottom of a document.

<p>Typically, an Address is rendered in an italic typeface and may be
indented. The Address element implies a paragraph break before and
after.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<ADDRESS>
Newsletter editor<BR>
J.R. Brown<BR>
JimquickPost News, Jumquick, CT 01234<BR>
Tel (123) 456 7890
</ADDRESS>
]]></listing>

<h2>Blockquote

<![CDATA[
<BLOCKQUOTE> ... </BLOCKQUOTE>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Blockquote element is used to contain text quoted from another
source.

<p>A typical rendering might be a slight extra left and right indent,
and/or italic font. The Blockquote element causes a paragraph break,
and typically provides space above and below the quote.

<p>Single-font rendition may reflect the quotation style of Internet
mail by putting a vertical line of graphic characters, such as the
greater than symbol (>), in the left margin.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
I think the poem ends
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Soft you now, the fair Ophelia. Nymph, in thy orisons, be all 
my sins remembered.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
but I am not sure.
]]></listing>
