<h2>Block Structuring Elements

<p>Each of the following elements defines a block structure; that is,
they indicate a paragraph break before and after.

<h3>Paragraph: <tag/P/

<p>The <tag/P/ element indicates a paragraph. The exact indentation,
leading space, etc. of a paragraph is not specified and may be a
function of other tags, style sheets, etc.

<p>Typically, paragraphs are surrounded by a vertical space of one
line or half a line. The first line in a paragraph is indented in some
cases.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<H1>This Heading Precedes the Paragraph</H1>
<P>This is the text of the first paragraph.
<P>This is the text of the second paragraph. Although you do not 
need to start paragraphs on new lines, maintaining this 
convention facilitates document maintenance.</P>
<P>This is the text of a third paragraph.</P>
]]></listing>

<h3 id=pre>Preformatted Text: <tag/PRE/

<p>The <tag/PRE/ element represents a character cell block of textand
so is suitable for text that has been formatted on screen.

<p>The <tag/PRE/ tag may be used with the optional WIDTH attribute. The
WIDTH attribute specifies the maximum number of characters for a line
and allows the HTML user agent to select a suitable font and
indentation.

<p>Within preformatted text:

<ul>
<li>Line breaks within the text are rendered as a move to the
beginning of the next line.
<NOTE>References to the "beginning of a new line" do not imply that
the renderer is forbidden from using a constant left indent for
rendering preformatted text. The left indent may be constrained by the
width required.
</note>

<li>Anchor elements and phrase markup may be used.
<NOTE>Within a Preformatted Text element, the constraint that the
rendering must be on a fixed horizontal character pitch may limit or
prevent the ability of the HTML user agent to faithfully render
phrase markup.
</note>

<li>Elements that define paragraph formatting (headings, address,
etc.) must not be used.
<NOTE>Som historical documents contain <tag/P/ tags in <tag/PRE/
elements.  User agents are engcouraged to treat this a a line break. A
<tag/P/ tag followed by a newline character should produce only one
line break, not a line break plus a blank line.
</note>

<li>The horizontal tab character (encoded in <code/US-ASCII/ and
<code/ISO-8859-1/ as decimal 9) must be interpreted as the smallest
positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number of
characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8.
</ul>

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<PRE>
This is an example line.
</PRE>
]]></listing>

<h3>Address: <tag/ADDRESS/

<p>The <tag/ADDRESS/ element specifies such information as address,
signature and authorship, often at the beginning or end of the body of
a document.

<p>Typically, the <tag/ADDRESS/ element is rendered in an italic
typeface and may be indented.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<ADDRESS>
Newsletter editor<BR>
J.R. Brown<BR>
JimquickPost News, Jumquick, CT 01234<BR>
Tel (123) 456 7890
</ADDRESS>
]]></listing>

<h3>Block Quote: <tag/BLOCKQUOTE/

<p>The <tag/BLOCKQUOTE/ element contains text quoted from another
source.

<p>A typical rendering might be a slight extra left and right indent,
and/or italic font. The <tag/BLOCKQUOTE/ typically provides space
above and below the quote.

<p>Single-font rendition may reflect the quotation style of Internet
mail by putting a vertical line of graphic characters, such as the
greater than symbol (>), in the left margin.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
I think the poem ends
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Soft you now, the fair Ophelia. Nymph, in thy orisons, be all 
my sins remembered.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
but I am not sure.
]]></listing>
