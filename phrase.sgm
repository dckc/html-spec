<h2>Phrase Markup

<p>Phrases may be marked up according to idiomatic usage,
typographic appearance, or for use as hyperlink anchors.

<p>User agents must render highlighted phrases distinctly from plain
text. Additionally, <tag/EM/ content must be rendered as distinct from
<tag/STRONG/ content, and <tag/B/ content must rendered as distinct
from <tag/I/ content.

<p>Phrase elements may be nested within the content of other phrase
elements; however, HTML user agents may render nested phrase
elements indistinctly from non-nested elements:

<listing><![CDATA[
plain <B>bold <I>italic</I></B> may the rendered 
the same as plain <B>bold </B><I>italic</I>
]]></listing>

<h3>Idiomatic Elements

Phrases may be marked up to indicate certain idioms.
<note>
User agents may support the <tag/DFN/ elmenent, not
included in this specification, as it has been deployed to some extent.
It is used to indicate the defining instance of a term, and it is
typically rendered in italic or bold italic.
</note>

<h4>Citation: CITE

<p>The <tag/CITE/ element is used to indicate the title of a book or
other citation. It is typically rendered as italics.  For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
He just couldn't get enough of <cite>The Grapes of Wrath</cite>.
]]></listing>

<h4>Code: CODE

<p>The <tag/CODE/ element indicates an example of code, typically
rendered in a monospaced font. Contrast with the <tag/PRE/ block
structuring element in <hdref refid=pre>. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
The expression <code>x += 1</code>
is short for <code>x = x + 1</code>.
]]></listing>

<h4>Emphasis: EM

<p>The <tag/EM/ element indicates an emphasized phrase, typically
rendered as italics. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
A singular subject <em>always</em> takes a singular verb.
]]></listing>

<h4>Keyboard: KBD

<p>The Keyboard element indicates text typed by a user, typically
rendered in a monospaced font. This is commonly used in instruction
manuals. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
Enter <kbd>FIND IT</kbd> to search the database.
]]></listing>

<h4>Sample: SAMP

<p>The <tag/SAMP/ element indicates a sequence of literal characters,
typically rendered in a monospaced font. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
The only word containing the letters <samp>mt</samp> is dreamt.
]]></listing>

<h4>Strong Empasis: STRONG

<p>The <tag/STRONG/ element indicates strong emphasis,
typically rendered in bold. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<strong>STOP</strong>, or I'll say "<strong>STOP</strong>" again!.
]]></listing>

<h4>Variable: VAR

<p>The <tag/VAR/ element indicates a placeholder, typically rendered
as italic. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
Take a guess: Roses are <var>blank</var>.
]]></listing>

<h3>Typographic Elements

<p>Typographic elements are used to specify the format of marked text.

<p>Typical renderings for idomatic elements vary between user
agents. If a specific rendering is necessary -- for example, when
referring to a specific text attribute as in "The italic parts are
mandatory" -- a typographic element can be used to ensure that the
intended typography is used where possible.

<note>
User agents may support some typographic elmenents not included in
this specification, as they have been deployed to some extent. The
<tag/STRIKE/ element indicates horizontal line through the characters,
and the <tag/U/ element indicates an underline.
</note>

<h4>Bold: B

<p>The <tag/B/ element indicates bold text. Where bold typography is
unavailable, an alternative representation may be used.

<h4>Italic: I

<p>The <tag/I/ element indicates italic text. Where italic typography
is unavailable, an alternative representation may be used.

<h4>Typewriter: TT

<p>The <tag/TT/ element indicates typewriter text. Where a typewriter
font is unavailable, an alternative representation may be used.

<h3 id=a>Anchor: A

<p>The <tag/A/ element indicates a hyperlink anchor (see <hdref
refid=hyperlink>). At least one of the <attr/NAME/ and <attr/HREF/
attributes should be present. Attributes of the <tag/A/ element:

<tl>
<tli>HREF: gives the URI of the head anchor of a hyperlink.

<tli>NAME: gives the name of the anchor, and makes it available as
a head of a hyperlink.

<tli>TITLE: suggests a title for the destination resource -- advisory only. 
The <attr/TITLE/ attribute may be used:

<ul>
<li> for display prior to accessing the destination resource, for
example, as a margin note or on a small box while the mouse is over
the anchor, or while the document is being loaded;

<li> for resources that do not specify a title such as graphics, plain
text and Gopher menus, for use as a window title.
</ul>

<tli>REL: The <attr/REL/ attribute gives the relationship(s) described
by the hyperlink. The value is a whitespace separated list of
relationship names.

<tli>REV: same as the REL attribute, but the semantics of the
relationship are in the reverse direction. A link from A to B with
REL="X" expresses the same relationship as a link from B to A with
REV="X". An anchor may have both REL and REV attributes.

<tli>URN: specifies a preferred, more persistent identifier for the
head anchor of the hyperlink. The format of URNs is under discussion
(1995) by various working groups of the Internet Engineering Task
Force.

<tli>METHODS: specifies methods to be used in accessing the
destination, as a whitespace-separated list of names. For similar
reasons as for the TITLE attribute, it may be useful to include the
information in advance in the link. For example, the HTML user agent
may chose a different rendering as a function of the methods allowed;
for example, something that is searchable may get a different icon.
</tl>

<h2>Line Break: BR

<p>The <tag/BR/ element specifies a line break between words (see
<hdref refid=datachrs>). For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<P> Pease porridge hot<BR>
Pease porridge cold<BR>
Pease porridge in the pot<BR>
Nine days old.
]]></listing>

<h2>Horizontal Rule: HR

<p>The <tag/HR/ element is a divider between sections of text;
typcially a full width horizontal rule or equivalent graphic. For
example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<HR>
<ADDRESS>February 8, 1995, CERN</ADDRESS>
</BODY>
]]></listing>

<h2 id=img>Image: IMG

<p>The <tag/IMG/ element refers to an image or icon via a hyperlink
(see <hdref refid=image-present>).

<p>HTML user agents may process the value of the <attr/ALT/ attribute
as an alternative to processing the image resource indicated by the
<attr/SRC/ attribute.
<note>Some HTML user agents can process graphics linked via anchors,
but not <tag/IMG/ graphics. If a graphic is essential, it should be
referenced from an <tag/A/ element rather than in <tag/IMG/ element. If
the graphic is not essential, then the <tag/IMG/ element is
appropriate.
</note>

<p>Attributes of the <tag/IMG/ element:

<tl>
<tli>ALIGN: alignment of the image with respect to the text
baseline.
<ul>
<li><code/TOP/ specifies that the top of the image aligns with the
tallest item on the line contianing the image.

<li><code/MIDDLE/ specifies that the center of the image aligns with
the baseline of the line containing the image.

<li><code/BOTTOM/ specifies that the bottom of the image aligns with
the baseline of the line containing the image.
</ul>

<tli>ALT: text to use in place of the referenced image resource, for
example due to processing constraints or user preference.

<tli>ISMAP: indicates an image map (see <hdref refid=imagemap>).

<tli>SRC: specifies the URI of the image resource.
<note>In practice, the media types of image resources are limited to a
few raster graphic formats: typically <code>image/gif</code>,
<code>image/jpeg</code>. In particular, <code>text/html</code>
resources are not intended to be used as image resources.
