<h1>Data Elements

<h2>Line Break

<![CDATA[
<BR>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Line Break element specifies that a new line must be started at
the given point. A new line indents the same as that of line-wrapped
text.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<P> Pease porridge hot<BR>
Pease porridge cold<BR>
Pease porridge in the pot<BR>
Nine days old.
]]></listing>

<h2>Horizontal Rule

<![CDATA[
<HR>	Level 0
]]>

<p>A Horizontal Rule element is a divider between sections of text
such as a full width horizontal rule or equivalent graphic.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<HR>
<ADDRESS>February 8, 1995, CERN</ADDRESS>
</BODY>
]]></listing>

<h2>Image

<![CDATA[
<IMG>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Image element is used to incorporate in-line graphics
(typically icons or small graphics) into an HTML document. This
element cannot be used for embedding other HTML text.

<p>HTML interpreters that cannot render in-line images ignore the
Image element unless it contains the ALT attribute. Note that some
HTML interpreters can render linked graphics but not in-line
graphics. If a graphic is essential, you may want to create a link to
it rather than to put it in-line. If the graphic is not essential,
then the Image element is appropriate.

<p>The Image element, which is empty (no closing tag), has these attributes:

<tl>
<tli>ALIGN: The ALIGN attribute accepts the values TOP or MIDDLE or
BOTTOM, which specifies if the following line of text is aligned with
the top, middle, or bottom of the graphic.

<tli>ALT:

Optional text as an alternative to the graphic for rendering in
non-graphical environments.  Alternate text should be provided
whenever the graphic is not rendered. Alternate text is mandatory for
Level 0 documents. Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<IMG SRC="triangle.xbm" ALT="Warning:"> Be sure 
to read these instructions.
]]></listing>

<tli>ISMAP:

The ISMAP (is map) attribute identifies an image as an image
map. Image maps are graphics in which certain regions are mapped to
URIs. By clicking on different regions, different resources can be
accessed from the same graphic. Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<A HREF="http://machine/htbin/imagemap/sample">
<IMG SRC="sample.xbm" ISMAP>
</A>
]]></listing>

<tli>SRC:

The value of the SRC attribute is the URI of the document to be
embedded; only images can be embedded, not HTML text. Its syntax is
the same as that of the HREF attribute of the <code>&lt;A></> tag. SRC is
mandatory. Image elements are allowed within anchors.
</tl>

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<IMG SRC="triangle.xbm">Be sure to read these 
instructions.
]]></listing>

<h1>Character Format Elements

<p>Character format elements are used to specify either the logical
meaning or the physical appearance of marked text without causing a
paragraph break. Like most other elements, character format elements
include both opening and closing tags. Only the characters between the
tags are affected:

<listing><![CDATA[
This is <EM>emphasized</EM> text.
]]></listing>

<p>Character format tags may be ignored by minimal HTML applications.

<p>Character format tags are interpreted from left to right as they
appear in the flow of text.  Level&nbsp;1 interpreters must render
highlighted text distinctly from plain text. Additionally, EM content
must be rendered as distinct from STRONG content, and B content must
rendered as distinct from I content.

<p>Character format elements may be nested within the content of other
character format elements; however, HTML interpreters are not required
to render nested character format elements distinctly from non-nested
elements:

<listing><![CDATA[
plain <B>bold <I>italic</I></B> may the rendered 
the same as plain <B>bold </B><I>italic</I>
]]></listing>

<h2>Semantic Format Elements

<p>Note that typical renderings for semantic format elements vary
between applications. If a specific rendering is necessary - for
example, when referring to a specific text attribute as in "The italic
parts are mandatory" - a physical formating element can be used to
ensure that the intended rendered is used where possible.

<p>Note that different sematic elements may be rendered in the same way.

<h3>Citation

<![CDATA[
<CITE>...</CITE>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Citation element specifies a citation, typically rendered as italics.

<h3>Code

<![CDATA[
<CODE> ... </CODE>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Code element indicates an example of code, typically rendered
in a monospaced font.  This should not be confused with the
Preformatted Text element.

<h3>Emphasis

<![CDATA[
<EM> ... </EM>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Emphasis element indicates typographic emphasis, typically
rendered as italics.

<h3>Keyboard

<![CDATA[
<KBD> ... </KBD>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Keyboard element indicates text typed by a user, typically
rendered in a monospaced font. This is commonly used in instruction
manuals.

<h3>Sample

<![CDATA[
<SAMP> ... </SAMP>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Sample element indicates a sequence of literal characters, typically rendered in a 
monospaced font.

<h3>Strong

<![CDATA[
<STRONG> ... </STRONG>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Strong element indicates strong typographic emphasis, typically rendered in bold.

<h3>Variable

<![CDATA[
<VAR> ... </VAR>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Variable element indicates a variable name, typically rendered as italic.

<h2>Physical Format Elements

<p>Physical format elements are used to specify the format of marked text.

<h3>Bold

<![CDATA[
<B> ... </B>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Bold element specifies that the text should be rendered in boldface, where available. 
Otherwise, an alternative mapping is allowed.

<h3>Italic

<![CDATA[
<I> ... </I>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Italic element specifies that the text should be rendered in an italic font, where 
available. Otherwise, an alternative mapping is allowed.

<h3>Teletype

<![CDATA[
<TT> ... </TT>	Level 1
]]>

<p>The Teletype element specifies that the text should be rendered in a fixed-width typewriter 
font.
