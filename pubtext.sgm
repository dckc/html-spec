<h1>HTML Document Type Definitions

<h2>Deprecated and Recommended Sections

<p>Optional "deprecated" and "recommended" sections are used in the HTML DTD. 
Conformance with this specification is defined with these sections disabled. In the liberal spirit 
of Section 3.3, user agents reading HTML documents should accept syntax corresponding to 
the specification with "deprecated" turned on. On the other hand, applications generating 
HTML should, in the conservative spirit, generate documents that conform to the specification 
with the "recommended" sections turned on.

<h2>Sample SGML Open Entity Catalog for HTML

<p>The SGML standard describes an "entity manager" as the portion or component of an 
SGML system that maps SGML entities into the actual storage model (e.g., the file system).  
The standard itself does not define a particular mapping methodology or notation.

<p>To assist the interoperability among various SGML tools and systems, the SGML Open 
consortium has passed a technical resolution that defines a format for an application-
independent entity catalog that maps external identifiers and/or entity names to file names.

<p>Each entry in the catalog associates a storage object identifier (such as a file name) with 
information about the external entity that appears in the SGML document.  In addition to 
entries that associate public identifiers, a catalog entry can associate an entity name with a 
storage object indentifier.  For example, the following are possible catalog entries:

&catalog;
