<h2>Sample SGML Open Entity Catalog for HTML

<p>The SGML standard describes an "entity manager" as the portion or
component of an SGML system that maps SGML entities into the actual
storage model (e.g., the file system).  The standard itself does not
define a particular mapping methodology or notation.

<p>To assist the interoperability among various SGML tools and
systems, the SGML Open consortium has passed a technical resolution
that defines a format for an application- independent entity catalog
that maps external identifiers and/or entity names to file names.

<p>Each entry in the catalog associates a storage object identifier
(such as a file name) with information about the external entity that
appears in the SGML document.  In addition to entries that associate
public identifiers, a catalog entry can associate an entity name with
a storage object identifier.  For example, the following are possible
catalog entries:
