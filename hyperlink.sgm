<h1 id=hyperlink>Hyperlinks

<p> In addition to general purpose elements such as paragraphs and
lists, HTML documents can express hyperlinks. A hyperlink is a
relationship between two resources, called the source and the
destination of the hyperlink. Each resource has a Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI).

<p> An HTML user agent allows navigating a collection of these
resources. In the following interactions, the URI of the source
document is called the base URI.

<h2>Accessing Resources

<p> Each of the following markup constructs is the source of a
hyperlink; these hyperlinks are references to resources to be
processed in conjunction with the source documents:

<ul>
<li> <tag/IMG/ elements
<li> <tag/INPUT/ elements with the <attr/SRC/ attribute present
<li> <tag/LINK/ element
</ul>

<p> To access the destination of a hyperlink, the base URI of the
source document is combined with the value of the <attr/HREF/ or
<attr/SRC/ attribute of the hyperlink element according to
[RELURL]. The user agent disregards any fragment identifer, and uses
the resulting URI to access the destination resource. For example, if
a document identified as <code>http://host/x/y.html</> contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<img src="../icons/abc.gif">
]]>
</listing>

<p> then the user agent must use the URI
<code>http://host/icons/abc.gif</> to access the resource linked from
the <tag/IMG/ element.

<h2 id=traverse>Traversing Hyperlinks

<p> An <tag/A/ element with the <attr/HREF/ attribute present is an
anchor; that is, the source of a hyperlink that is an option to
navigate to another resource.  The <tag/LINK/ element may also
be an anchor.

<p> In addition to the base URI, the state of an HTML user agent
includes a list of the anchors in the document. The user can traverse
a hyperlink by choosing an anchor. The user agent then accesses the
destination document as above and presents it.

<h3>Fragment Identifiers

<p>If the value of the <tag/HREF/ attribute of an anchor element
contains a <code/#/ character, then the characters after the <code/#/
are a fragment identifier, not a part of the destination URI. As a
degenerate case, <code/HREF="#fragment"/ refers to an anchor in the
same document: the source and destination URIs are the same.

<p>After accessing the destination resource, the navigation state (the
scrollbar, for example) may be modified by a fragment identifer in the
hyperlink source markup. The meaning of fragment identifiers depends
on the media type of the destination resource. For <code>text/html</>
resources, it instructs the user agent to locate the <tag/A/ element
with a <attr/NAME/ attribute whose value is the same as the fragment
identifier. The matching is case sensitive.

<p> For example, if a user
agent was processing the above document and the user indicated the
following anchor:

<listing>
<![CDATA[
<p> See: <a href="app1.html#bannanas">appendix 1</a> for more detail
on bannanas.</a>
]]>
</listing>

<p> then the user agent URI must access the resource
<code>http://host/x/app1.html</>. Assuming the resource is represented
using the <code>text/html</> media type, the user agent must locate
the anchor named <code>bannanas</> and begin navigation there.

<p> The base URI for navigating the destination document may be
different from the URI used to access it. For example, it may be
replaced by by a <tag/BASE/ tag in the destination document or by an
HTTP redirection transaction.

<h2 id=query>Queries and Indexes

<p> The <tag/ISINDEX/ element represents a set of hyperlinks. The user
can choose from the set by providing keywords to the user agent. The
user agent computes the destination URI by appending <code/?/ and the
keywords to the base URI. The keywords are escaped according to [URL]
and joined by <code/+/. For example, if a document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<BASE HREF="http://host/index">
<ISINDEX>
]]></listing>

<p> and the user provides the keywords <code/apple/ and <code/berry/,
then the user agent must access the resource
<code>http://host/index?apple+berry</>.

<p> <tag/FORM/ elements with <code/METHOD=GET/ also represent sets of
hyperlinks. See <hdref refid=queryf> for details.

<h2 id=imagemap>Image Maps

<p> The <attr/ISMAP/ attribute in combination with the <tag/A/ and
<tag/IMG/ elements, represents a set of hyperlinks. The user can
choose from the set by choosing a pixel of the image. The user agent
computes the destination URI by appending <code/?/ and the coordinates
of the pixel to the URI given in the <tag/A/ element. For example, if
a document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<head><title>ImageMap Example</title>
<BASE HREF="http://host/index"></head>
<body>
<p> Choose any of these icons:<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/imagemap"><img ismap src="icons.gif"></a>
]]></listing>

<p> and the user chooses the upper-leftmost pixel, then chosen
hyperlink is the one with the URI
<code>http://host/cgi-bin/image?0,0</>.
