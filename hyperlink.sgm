<h1 id=hyperlink>Hyperlinks

<p> In addition to general purpose elements such as paragraphs and
lists, HTML documents can express hyperlinks. An HTML user agent
allows the user to navigate these hyperlinks.

<p> A hyperlink is a relationship between two anchors, called the head
and the tail of the hyperlink[DEXTER]. Each anchor is addressed, or
uniquely identified, by an absolute Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),
optionally followed by a '#' and a sequence of characters called a
fragment identifier, as per [RELURL]. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html#z31
]]>
</listing>

<p>In an anchor address, the URI refers to a resource; it may be used
in a variety of information retrieval protocols to obtain an entity
that represents the resource, such as an HTML document. The fragment
identifier, if present, refers to some view on, or portion of the
resource.

<p>An HTML user agent begins navigation with an absolute URI, called
the base URI, and an HTML document that is a representation of the
resource identified by the base URI.

<p> Each of the following markup constructs indicates the tail anchor
of a hyperlink or set of hyperlinks:

<ul>
<li> <tag/A/ elements with <attr/HREF/ present.
<li> <tag/LINK/ elements.
<li> <tag/IMG/ elements.
<li> <tag/INPUT/ elements with the <attr/SRC/ attribute present.
<li> <tag/ISINDEX/ elements.
<li> <tag/FORM/ elements with <code/METHOD=GET/.
</ul>

<p>These markup constructs refer to head anchors either directly by
means of an absolute URI, or indirectly by means of a relative URI,
which must be combined with the base URI as in [RELURL] to determine
the address of the head anchor. The markup may also include fragment
identifiers, separated from the URI by a '#' character.

<h2>Accessing Resources

<p>Once the address of the head anchor is determined, the user agent
may obtain a representation of the resource, for example as in [URL].

<p>For example, if the base URI is <code>http://host/x/y.html</> and
the document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<img src="../icons/abc.gif">
]]>
</listing>

<p> then the user agent uses the URI
<code>http://host/icons/abc.gif</> to access the resource linked from
the <tag/IMG/ element.

<p>If the URI in the address of the head anchor is the same as the
base URI, then the base document is sufficient as a representation of
the resource. A user agent must <emph/not/, for example, use any
network information retrieval protocols to obtain a new representation
of the resourse.

<p>For example, if the base uri is
<code/http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html/, then each of
the following markup constructs indicates a link whose head and tail
anchors have the same URI in their address:

<listing><![CDATA[
<a href="#xyz">
<a href="../WWW/TheProject.html">
<a href="./TheProject.html">
<a href="TheProject.html">
<a href="TheProject.html#z21">
<a href="../../hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">
]]>
</listing>


<h2 id=traverse>Activation of Hyperlinks

<p>An HTML user agent allows the user to navigate the content of the
document and request activation of hyperlinks denoted by <tag/A/
elements. HTML user agents should also allow activation of <tag/LINK/
element hyperlinks.

<p> To activate a link, the user agent obtains a representation of the
resource identified in the address of the head anchor. If the
representation is another HTML document, navigation may begin again
with this new document. The base URI for navigation is taken from the
head anchor by default; however, any <tag/BASE/ tag in the destination
document overrides this default. The process of obtaining the
destination document may also override the base URI, as in the case of
an HTTP <code/URI:/ header or redirection transaction.

<h2 id=image-present>Simultaneous Presentation of Image Resources

An HTML user agent may activate hyperlinks indicated by <tag/IMG/ and
<tag/INPUT/ elements concurrently with processing the document; that
is, image hyperlinks may be processed without explicit request by the
user. Image resources should be embedded in the presentation at the
point of the tail anchor, that is the <tag/IMG/ or <tag/INPUT/ element.

<tag/LINK/ hyperlinks may also be processed without explicit user
request; for example, style sheet resources may be processed before or
during the processing of the document.

<h2>Fragment Identifiers

Any characters following a <code/#/ character in a hypertext address
constitute a fragment identifier. In particular, an address of
the form <code/#fragment/ refers to an anchor in the same document.

The meaning of fragment identifiers depends on the media type of the
representation of the anchor's resource. For <code>text/html</>
representations, it refers to the <tag/A/ element with a <attr/NAME/
attribute whose value is the same as the fragment identifier. The
matching is case sensitive. The document should have exactly one such
element. The user agent should indicate the anchor element, for
example by scrolling to and/or highlighting the phrase.

For example, if the base URI is <code>http://host/x/y.html</> and the
user activated the link denoted by the following markup:

<listing>
<![CDATA[
<p> See: <a href="app1.html#bananas">appendix 1</a> 
for more detail on bananas.
]]>
</listing>

<p>Then the user agent accesses the resource identified by
<code>http://host/x/app1.html</>. Assuming the resource is represented
using the <code>text/html</> media type, the user agent must locate
the <tag/A/ element whose <attr/NAME/ attribute is <code>bananas</>
and begin navigation there.

<h2 id=query>Queries and Indexes

<p> The <tag/ISINDEX/ element represents a set of hyperlinks. The user
can choose from the set by providing keywords to the user agent. The
user agent computes the head URI by appending <code/?/ and the
keywords to the base URI. The keywords are escaped according to [URL]
and joined by <code/+/. For example, if a document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<BASE HREF="http://host/index">
<ISINDEX>
]]></listing>

<p> and the user provides the keywords <code/apple/ and <code/berry/,
then the user agent must access the resource
<code>http://host/index?apple+berry</>.

<p> <tag/FORM/ elements with <code/METHOD=GET/ also represent sets of
hyperlinks. See <hdref refid=queryf> for details.

<h2 id=imagemap>Image Maps

<p> If the <attr/ISMAP/ attribute is present on an <tag/IMG/ element,
the <tag/IMG/ element must be contained in an <tag/A/ element with an
<attr/HREF/ present. This construct represents a set of
hyperlinks. The user can choose from the set by choosing a pixel of
the image. The user agent computes the head URI by appending <code/?/
and the x and y coordinates of the pixel to the URI given in the
<tag/A/ element. For example, if a document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<head><title>ImageMap Example</title>
<BASE HREF="http://host/index"></head>
<body>
<p> Choose any of these icons:<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/imagemap"><img ismap src="icons.gif"></a>
]]></listing>

<p> and the user chooses the upper-leftmost pixel, the chosen
hyperlink is the one with the URI
<code>http://host/cgi-bin/imagemap?0,0</>.
