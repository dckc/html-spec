<h1 id=hyperlink>Hyperlinks

<p> In addition to general purpose elements such as paragraphs and
lists, HTML documents can express hyperlinks. A hyperlink is a
relationship between two anchors, called the head and the tail of the
hyperlink[DEXTER]. An anchor is a resource such as an HTML document,
or some fragment of, i.e. view on or portion of a resource.
Typically, the user activates a link by indicating the tail of the
link; the head of the link is presented as a result.

<p> Anchors are addressed by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). URIs
either refer directly to an anchor in absolute form for example as in
[URL], or they refer to an anchor relative to a base URI which is
absolute, as in [RELURL].

<p> Each of the following markup constructs indicates the tail anchor
of a hyperlink or set of hyperlinks:

<ul>
<li> <tag/A/ elements with <attr/HREF/ present.
<li> <tag/LINK/ elements.
<li> <tag/IMG/ elements.
<li> <tag/INPUT/ elements with the <attr/SRC/ attribute present.
<li> <tag/ISINDEX/ elements.
<li> <tag/FORM/ elements with <code/METHOD=GET/.
</ul>

<h2>Accessing Resources

<p> To access the head anchor of a hyperlink, the user agent
determines its URI from the URI given in the tail anchor, using the
base URI of the document containing the tail anchor if necessary. Any
fragment identifier is discarded, and the result is used to access a
resource, for example as in [URL].

For example, if a document identified as <code>http://host/x/y.html</>
contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<img src="../icons/abc.gif">
]]>
</listing>

<p> then the user agent must use the URI
<code>http://host/icons/abc.gif</> to access the resource linked from
the <tag/IMG/ element.

<h2 id=traverse>Activation of Hyperlinks

<p>An HTML user agent allows the user to navigate the content of the
document and request activation of <tag/A/ element hyperlinks. A
request to activate a link is essentially a request to process the
resource indicated by the head anchor of the link, for example to
display the indicated HTML document. HTML user agents should also
allow activation of <tag/LINK/ element hyperlinks.

<p> The base URI for navigating the head anchor may be different from
the URI used to access it. For example, it may be replaced by a
<tag/BASE/ tag in the destination document or by an HTTP redirection
transaction.

<h2 id=image-present>Simultaneous Presentation of Image Resources

An HTML user agent may activate hyperlinks indicated by <tag/IMG/ and
<tag/INPUT/ elements concurrently with processing the document; that
is, image hyperlinks may be processed without explicit request by the
user. Image resources should be embedded in the presentation at the
point of the tail anchor, that is the <tag/IMG/ or <tag/INPUT/ element.

<tag/LINK/ hyperlinks may also be processed without explicit user
request; for example, style sheet resources may be processed before or
during the processing of the document.

<h2>Fragment Identifiers

Any characters following a <code/#/ character in a URI constitute a
fragment identifier. As a degenerate case, a URI of the form
<code/#fragment/ refers to an anchor in the same document.

The meaning of fragment identifiers depends on the media type of the
resource containing the head anchor. For <code>text/html</> resources,
it refers to the <tag/A/ element with a <attr/NAME/ attribute whose
value is the same as the fragment identifier. The matching is case
sensitive. The document should have exactly one such element. The user
agent should indicate the anchor element, for example by scrolling to
and/or highlighting the phrase.

For example, if a user agent was processing a document identified as
<code>http://host/x/y.html</> and the user indicated the following
anchor:

<listing>
<![CDATA[
<p> See: <a href="app1.html#bananas">appendix 1</a> 
for more detail on bananas.
]]>
</listing>

<p> then the user agent URI must access the resource
<code>http://host/x/app1.html</>. Assuming the resource is represented
using the <code>text/html</> media type, the user agent must locate
the anchor named <code>bananas</> and begin navigation there.

<h2 id=query>Queries and Indexes

<p> The <tag/ISINDEX/ element represents a set of hyperlinks. The user
can choose from the set by providing keywords to the user agent. The
user agent computes the head URI by appending <code/?/ and the
keywords to the base URI. The keywords are escaped according to [URL]
and joined by <code/+/. For example, if a document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<BASE HREF="http://host/index">
<ISINDEX>
]]></listing>

<p> and the user provides the keywords <code/apple/ and <code/berry/,
then the user agent must access the resource
<code>http://host/index?apple+berry</>.

<p> <tag/FORM/ elements with <code/METHOD=GET/ also represent sets of
hyperlinks. See <hdref refid=queryf> for details.

<h2 id=imagemap>Image Maps

<p> If the <attr/ISMAP/ attribute is present on an <tag/IMG/ element,
the <tag/IMG/ element must be contained in an <tag/A/ element with an
<attr/HREF/ present. This construct represents a set of
hyperlinks. The user can choose from the set by choosing a pixel of
the image. The user agent computes the head URI by appending <code/?/
and the x and y coordinates of the pixel to the URI given in the
<tag/A/ element. For example, if a document contains:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<head><title>ImageMap Example</title>
<BASE HREF="http://host/index"></head>
<body>
<p> Choose any of these icons:<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/imagemap"><img ismap src="icons.gif"></a>
]]></listing>

<p> and the user chooses the upper-leftmost pixel, the chosen
hyperlink is the one with the URI
<code>http://host/cgi-bin/imagemap?0,0</>.
