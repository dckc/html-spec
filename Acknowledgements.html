<P>The HTML document type was designed initially at CERN in 1990
for the World-Wide Web project. The DTD was written,
and the specification tightened up, by Dan Connolly After much
discussion on the network and some enhancement in particular
the addition of inline images introduced by the NCSA "Mosaic"
software for WWW, it was released as an Internet draft in 1993.

<P>This version of the specification follows from certain minor
changes made at the WWW Wizard's Workshop in Cambridge,
Mass., in July 1993, in particular the introduction of &lt;HR&#62;,
&lt;BR&#62;, &amp;nbsp.
