<P>The HTML document type was designed initially at CERN in 1990
for the World-Wide Web project. The DTD was written,
and the specification tightened up, by Dan Connolly in 1992.

<P>An internet draft was release in June of 1992 after much discussion
on the network and some enhancement in particular the addition
of inline images introduced by the NCSA "Mosaic" software for
WWW.

<P>The FORMS material is derived from the HTML+ specification
with the help of Dave Raggett.

<P>This document is the work of many contributors.
Many thanks to Erik Naggum and James Clark for making SGML technology
available, and to Terry Allen, Dave Raggett,
Marc Andressen, William Perry, and the rest of the WWW community.
