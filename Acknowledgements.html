<P>The HTML document type was designed initially at CERN in 1990
for the World-Wide Web project. The DTD was written,
and the specification tightened up, by Dan Connolly.
After much discussion on the network and some enhancement in
particular the addition of inline images introduced by the NCSA
"Mosaic" software for WWW, it was released as an Internet draft
in 1993.

<P>The internet draft has since expired.
This version of the specification is an attempt to capture the
state of current practice, as a basis for review and enhancement.
