Fall '94, Chicago</a> </h3>

<p> Eric Sink and Mike Knezovich from Spyglass have been preparing a
    draft of the document for distribution and discussion at the conference.
    Eric announced its availability recently.

     postscript file (patched as per Roy Fielding's suggestion)
     (~100K, compressed)</a>

     Roy Fielding's copy on an FTP server</a>.<br>
     Try this if you have trouble downloading
     via HTTP. (Does anybody know why HTTP clients have troubles
     with compressed files? Or is it the server?)

</ul>

<p> <strong>NOTE</strong> I will <em>not</em> be attending the Chicago
    WWW conference. My wife and I are expecting a baby, and the due
    date is October 22. There are not many things that would keep me
    away from the conference, but this is definitely one of them.

<p> The document is now available in several formats. See <a

<h3>Preparation for Toronto IETF meeting</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.hal.com/~karen">Karen Muldrow</a>
    <tt>&lt;karen@hal.com&gt;</tt>, and I did a lot of work to get
    a printed version of the document ready for the Toronto IETF
    meeting.

<H3>August 2 Release</h3>

<p> See: <A name="contents"
    href="http://www.hal.com/products/sw/olias/Build-html/buhC2XBDmmF84aK.html">The
    Contents as Hypertext as of August 2, 1994</a>

<p> Note that this hypertext is subject to change without notice.

<p> The latest revision was generated from an SGML document in another
    DTD (similar to DocBook). The converted HTML doesn't yet conform
    to the 2.0 standard. Talk about irony!

<H3>July 1994 (Toronto IETF) Release</H3>

<p> This is the current (as of this writing, Aug 12) document under
    consideration by the HTML working group.

<H2>Review and Publication Process</H2>

<p> The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international
    consortium in the future, but the need for this document is
    immediate. SGML Open and the Internet Engineering Task Force have
    offered to host this review.

<p> For details on the status of HTML as an SGML Open technical
    report, contact Yuri Rubinsky, <tt>&lt;yuri@sq.com&gt;</tt>.

<p> The document will be publicly available throughout the review
    process.

<p> To prevent duplicate comments on similar issues, <strong>I reserve
    the right to publicly redistribute all comments sent to me
    regarding the HTML 2.0 spec.</strong> I will use discretion in
    making old messages available without the expressed consent of the
    author, but in the future, consent will be implictly given just by
    commenting on the HTML 2.0 document. If you have sent me comments
    on the HTML 2.0 document that you don't want made public, please
    let me know.

<H2>Background and Related Materials</H2>

<p> The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in
    July of 1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in
    the usage of HTML, and certain new features have
    emerged. Widespread commercial support for HTML is on the
    horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of features
    in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.

<p> These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability
    among developing HTML implementations, and to investigate
    interactions with implementations that support more or fewer
    features than the current practice.
