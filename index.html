<h1>HTML Specification</h1>

<H2>Status: In Review</H2>

<p> The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in
    July of 1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in
    the usage of HTML, and certain new features have
    emerged. Widespread commercial support for HTML is on the
    horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of features
    in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.

<p> These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability
    among developing HTML implementations, and to investigate
    interactions with implementations that support more or fewer
    features than the current practice.

<p> I consider the document at "first draft" stage -- most of the
    technical issues have been thought out (but not widely reviewed),
    but there has been very little emphasis on editorial matters.

<H2>Review and Publication Process</H2>

<p> The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international
    consortium in the future, but since the need for this document is
    immediate, it will be published as an SGML Open Technical
    Report. An SGML Open technical committee is forming. Contact Dan
    Connolly <code>&lt;connolly@hal.com&gt;</code>, or Yuri Rubinsky,
    <code>&lt;yuri@sq.com&gt;</code> for details.

<p> The document will be publicly available throughout the review
    process.

<p> We are trying to set up a publicly available archive of the review
    comments. Currently, <a
    href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Discussion">a WIT
    discussion area</a> and <a
    href="http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-html-1994q2.index.html">
    a hypermail archive of www-html</a> are candidates.

<p> When the public archive mechanism becomes stable, I intend to
    upload my collection of comments on the HTML spec to that
    archive. And in general, to prevent duplicate comments on similar
    issues, <strong>I reserve the right to publicly redistribute all
    comments sent to me regarding the HTML 2.0 spec.</strong> I will
    use discretion in making old messages available without the
    expressed consent of the author, but in the future, consent will
    be implictly given just by commenting on the HTML 2.0 document. If
    you have sent me comments on the HTML 2.0 document that you don't
    want made public, please let me know.
