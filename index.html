<h1>HTML Specification</h1>

<H2>Status: In Review</H2>

<p> The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in
    June of 1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in
    the usage of HTML, and certain new features have
    emerged. Widespread commercial support for HTML is on the
    horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of features
    in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.

<p> These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability
    among developing HTML implementations, and to investigate
    interactions with implementations that support more or fewer
    features than the current practice.

<H2>Review and Publication Process</H2>

<p> The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an emerging
    international consortium in the future, but since the need for
    this document is immediate, it will be published as an SGML Open
    Technical Report. An SGML Open technical committee is forming.
    Contact Dan Connolly <code>&lt;connolly@hal.com&gt;</code>, or
    Yuri Rubinski, <code>&lt;yuri@sq.com&gt;</code> for details.

<p> As usual, the document will be publicly available throughout the
    review process, and comments may be submitted through internet
    mail to the editors or to the
    <code>&lt;www-talk@info.cern.ch&gt;</code> mailing list.
