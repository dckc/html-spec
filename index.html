<h1>HTML Specification</h1>

<H2>Status: In Review</H2>

<p> The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in
    July of 1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in
    the usage of HTML, and certain new features have
    emerged. Widespread commercial support for HTML is on the
    horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of features
    in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.

<p> These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability
    among developing HTML implementations, and to investigate
    interactions with implementations that support more or fewer
    features than the current practice.

<p> I believe the document could use some substantial reorganization,
    but given the current time constraints, such editorial matters
    will not receive a lot of attention for some time.

<p> As to the technical issues, after only 10 days, we are still in
    the up-hill phase of the review. I expect the technical issues to
    be largely stable in another week or two.

<H2>Review and Publication Process</H2>

<p> The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international
    consortium in the future, but since the need for this document is
    immediate, it will be published as an SGML Open Technical
    Report. An SGML Open technical committee is forming. Contact Dan
    Connolly <code>&lt;connolly@hal.com&gt;</code>, or Yuri Rubinsky,
    <code>&lt;yuri@sq.com&gt;</code> for details.

<p> The document will be publicly available throughout the review
    process.

<p> Ron Daniel <code>&lt;rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov&gt;</code> has
    voluntered to maintain <a
    href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/HTML/html-archive.subject-index.html">an
    archive of the review comments</a>

<p> I maintain <a href="notes/ReviewTopics.html">a WIT-style
    (Topic/Proposal/Argument) view of the comments</a>.

<p> To prevent duplicate comments on similar issues, <strong>I reserve
    the right to publicly redistribute all comments sent to me
    regarding the HTML 2.0 spec.</strong> I will use discretion in
    making old messages available without the expressed consent of the
    author, but in the future, consent will be implictly given just by
    commenting on the HTML 2.0 document. If you have sent me comments
    on the HTML 2.0 document that you don't want made public, please
    let me know.
