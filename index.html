<h1>HTML Specification</h1>

<H2>Status: In Final Review</H2>

<p> <a href="http://www.hal.com/~karen">Karen Muldrow</a>
    <tt>&lt;karen@hal.com&gt;</tt>, has just completed a
    stylistic/editorial rewrite. An HTML version is available (see <a
    href="#contents">below</a>). I'll have hardcopy for the <a
    href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/ietf/0mtg-at-a-glance-94jul.txt">July IETF
    meeting in toronto</a>, where the review committe will probably
    take on the role of an IETF working group.

<H2><A name="contents"
href="http://www.hal.com/products/sw/olias/Build-html/buhC2XBDmmF84aK.html">The
Contents as Hypertext</a></H2>

<p> Note that this hypertext is subject to change without notice.

<p> The latest revision was generated from an SGML document in another
    DTD (similar to DocBook). The converted HTML doesn't yet conform
    to the 2.0 standard. Talk about irony!

<H2>Review and Publication Process</H2>

<p> The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international
    consortium in the future, but the need for this document is
    immediate. SGML Open and the Internet Engineering Task Force have
    offered to host this review.

<p> For details on the status of HTML as an SGML Open technical
    report, contact Yuri Rubinsky, <tt>&lt;yuri@sq.com&gt;</tt>.

<p> There will be a BOF at the July IETF meeting to discuss the
    formation of an HTML WG in the IETF. (See <cite><a
    href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/HTML/html-archive.messages/161.html">HTML
    BOF is Tuesday</a></cite> from TimBL)

<p> The document will be publicly available throughout the review
    process.

<p> Ron Daniel <code>&lt;rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov&gt;</code> has
    voluntered to maintain <a
    href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/HTML/html-archive.subject-index.html">an
    archive of the review comments</a>

<p> To prevent duplicate comments on similar issues, <strong>I reserve
    the right to publicly redistribute all comments sent to me
    regarding the HTML 2.0 spec.</strong> I will use discretion in
    making old messages available without the expressed consent of the
    author, but in the future, consent will be implictly given just by
    commenting on the HTML 2.0 document. If you have sent me comments
    on the HTML 2.0 document that you don't want made public, please
    let me know.

<H2>The whole document as of the 19940613 release</H2>

<p><em>Note that significant edits have occurred since then. We plan
to have these aggregate distributions up to date in the next two
weeks.</em>

<H2>Background and Related Materials</H2>

<p> The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in
    July of 1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in
    the usage of HTML, and certain new features have
    emerged. Widespread commercial support for HTML is on the
    horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of features
    in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.

<p> These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability
    among developing HTML implementations, and to investigate
    interactions with implementations that support more or fewer
    features than the current practice.
