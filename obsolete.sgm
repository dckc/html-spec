<h1> Obsolete Features

<p>This section describes elements that are no longer part of HTML. Client implementors 
should implement these obsolete elements for compatibility with previous versions of the 
HTML specification.

<h2> Comment Element

<p>The Comment element is used to delimit unneeded text and comments. The Comment 
element has been introduced in some HTML applications but should be replaced by the SGML 
comment feature in new HTML interpreters (see Section 2.2.5).

<h2>  Highlighted Phrase Element

<![CDATA[
<HP>
]]>

<p>The Highlighted Phrase element should be ignored if not implemented. This element has 
been replaced by more meaningful elements (see Section 8).

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<HP1>first highlighted phrase</HP1>non-
highlighted text<HP2>second highlighted phrase</HP2> etc.
]]></listing>

<h2> Plain Text Element

<![CDATA[
<PLAINTEXT>
]]>

<p>The Plain Text element is used to terminates the HTML entity and to
indicate that what follows is not SGML which does not require
parsing. Instead, an old HTTP convention specified that what followed
was an ASCII (MIME "text/plain") body. Its presence is an
optimization. There is no closing tag.

<p>Example of use:

<listing><![CDATA[
<PLAINTEXT>
0001 This is line one of a long listing
0002 file from <ANY@HOST.INC.COM> which is sent
]]></listing>

<h2> Example and Listing Elements

<![CDATA[
<XMP> ... </XMP> and <LISTING> ... </LISTING>
]]>

<p>The Example and Listing elements have been replaced by the
Preformatted Text element (Section 10.2).

<p>These styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded
absolutely as is into the document. The syntax is:

<listing><![CDATA[
<LISTING> ... </LISTING>
]]>
</listing>

<p>or

<listing><![CDATA[
<XMP> ... </XMP>
]]>
</listing>

<p>The text between these tags is typically rendered in a monospaced
font so that any formatting done by character spacing on successive
lines will be maintained.

<p>Between the opening and closing tags:

<ul>
<li>The text may contain any ISO Latin-1 printable characters,
expect for the end tag opener. The Example and Listing elements have
historically used specifications which do not conform to
SGML. Specifically, the text may contain ISO Latin printable
characters, including the tag opener, as long it they does not contain
the closing tag in full.

<li>SGML does not support this form. HTML interpreters may vary on
how they interpret other tags within Example and Listing elements.

<li>Line boundaries within the text are rendered as a move to the
beginning of the next line, except for one immediately following a
start tag or immediately preceding an end tag.

<li>The horizontal tab character must be interpreted as the smallest
positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number of
characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not
recommended.
</ul>

<p>The Listing element is rendered so that at least 132 characters fit
on a line. The Example element is rendered to that at least 80
characters fit on a line but is otherwise identical to the Listing
element.
