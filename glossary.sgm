<h1>Terms

<tl>
<tli>absolute URI: a URI in absolute form, as per [URL]

<tli>anchor: a hyperlink navigation option; typically, a highlighted
phrase marked as an <tag/A/ element.

<tli>base URI: URI used as the base of an HTML document for the
purpose of resolving hyperlink destinations.

<tli>character: An atom of information, for example a letter or a
digit.  Graphic characters have associated glyphs, where as control
characters have associated processing semantics.

<tli>character encoding scheme: A function whose domain is the set of
sequences of octets, and whose range is the set of sequences of
characters from a character repertoire; that is, a sequence of octets
and a character encoding scheme determines a sequence of characters.

<tli>character repertoire: A finite set of characters; e.g. the range
of a coded character set.

<tli>code position: An integer. A coded character set and a code
position from its domain determine a character.

<tli>coded character set: A function whose domain is a subset of the
integers and whose range is a character repertoire. That is, for some
set of integers (usually of the form {0, 1, 2, ..., N} ), a coded
character set and an integer in that set determine a
character. Conversely, a character and a coded character set determine
the character's code position (or, in rare cases, a few code
positions).

<tli>conforming HTML user agent: A user agent that conforms to this
specification in its processing of the Internet Media Type
<code>text/html</code>.

<tli>data character: Characters other than markup, which make up the
content of elements.

<tli>document character set: a coded character set whose range
includes all characters used in a document. Every SGML document has
exactly one document character set. Numeric character references are
resolved via the document character set.

<tli>DTD: document type definition. Rules that apply SGML to the
markup of documents of a particular type, including a set of element
and entity declarations. [SGML]

<tli>element: A component of the hierarchical structure defined by a document type definition; it is identified in a document instance by descriptive markup, sually a start-tag and end-tag. [SGML]

<tli>end-tag: Descriptive markup that identifies the end of an
element. [SGML]

<tli>entity: data with an associated notation or interpretation; for
example, a sequence of octets associated with an Internet Media
Type.[SGML]

<tli>fragment identifier: the portion of an <attr/HREF/ attribute
value following the <code/#/ character which modifies the prenentation
of the destination of a hyperlink.

<tli>form data set: a sequence of name/value pairs; the names are
given by an HTML document and the values are given by a user.

<tli>HTML document: An SGML document conforming to this document type
definition.

<tli>hyperlink: a relationship between to resources, called the source
and the destination.

<tli>markup: Syntactically delimited characters added to the data of a
document to represent its structure. There are four different kinds of
markup: descriptive markup (tags), references, markup declarations,
and processing instructions.[SGML]

<tli>may: A document or user interface is conforming whether this
statement applies or not.

<tli>media type: an Internet Media Type, as per [IMEDIA].

<tli>message entity: a head and body. The head is a collection of
name/value fields, and the body is a sequence of octets. The head
defines the content type and content transfer encoding of the body. [MIME]

<tli>minimally conforming HTML user agent: A user agent that conforms
to this specification except for form processing. It may only process
level 1 HTML documents.

<tli>must: Documents or user agents in conflict with this statement
are not conforming.

<tli>SGML document: A sequence of characters organized physically as a
set of entities and logically into a hierarchy of elements. An SGML
document consists of data characters and markup; the markup describes
the structure of the information and an instance of that
structure.[SGML]

<tli>shall: If a document or user agent conflicts with this statement,
it does not conform to this specification.

<tli>should: If a document or user agent conflicts with this
statement, undesirable results may occur in practice even though it
conforms to this specification.

<tli>start-tag: Descriptive markup that identifies the start of an
element and specifies its generic identifier and attributes. [SGML]

<tli>syntax-reference character set: A coded character set whose range
includes all characters used for markup; e.g. name characters and
delimiter characters.

<tli>tag: Markup that delimits an element. A tag includes a name which
refers to an element declaration in the DTD, and may include
attributes.[SGML]

<tli>text entity: A finite sequence of characters. A text entity
typically takes the form of a sequence of octets with some associated
character encoding scheme, transmitted over the network or stored in a
file.[SGML]

<tli>typical: Typical processing is described for many elements. This
is not a mandatory part of the specification but is given as guidance
for designers and to help explain the uses for which the elements were
intended.

<tli>URI: A Universal Resource Identifier is a formatted string that
serves as an identifier for a resource, typcally on the Internet. URIs
are used in HTML to identify the destination of hyperlinks. URIs in
common practice include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)[URL]
and Relative URLs[RELURL].

<tli>user agent: A component of a distributed system that presents
an interface and processes requests on behalf of a user; for example,
a www browser or a mail user agent.

<tli>WWW: The World-Wide Web is a hypertext-based, distributed
information system created by researchers at CERN in
Switzerland. Users may create, edit or browse hypertext
documents. <code>http://www.w3.org/</>
