><h1>Document Structure Elements

<p>To identify information as an HTML document conforming to this
specification, each document should start with the prologue:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
]]></listing>

<NOTE>If the body of a text/html body part does not begin with a
document type declaration, an HTML user agent should infer the above
document type declaration.
</note>

HTML user agents are required to support the above document type
declaration, the following document type declarations, and no
others.

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0 Strict//EN">
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML Strict//EN">
]]></listing>
<![%level[@@]]>

In particular, they may support other formal public identifiers, or
document types altogether. They may support an internal declaration
subset with supplemental entity, element, and other markup
declarations, or they may not.

<h2>HTML Document Element

<![CDATA[
<HTML> ... </HTML>	Level 0
]]>

The HTML document element is organized as a head and a body, much
like a memo or a mail message. Within the head, you can specify the
title and other information about the document. Within the body,
you can structure text into paragraphs and lists, as well as
highlight phrases and create links, using HTML elements.

<note>The start and end tags for HTML, Head, 
and Body elements are omissible; however, this is not 
recommended since the head/body structure allows an 
implementation to determine certain properties of a 
document, such as the title, without parsing the entire 
document.
</note<


<h2>Head

<![CDATA[
<HEAD> ... </HEAD>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The head of an HTML document is an unordered collection of
information about the document. The Title element is required.

<listing><![CDATA[
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Introduction to HTML</TITLE>
</HEAD>
]]></listing>

<h2>Body

<![CDATA[
<BODY> ... </BODY>	Level 0
]]>

<p>The Body element identifies the body component of an HTML
document. Specifically, the body of a document may contain links,
text, and formatting information within &lt;BODY> and &lt;/BODY> tags.
