<h1>Document Structure

<p>To identify information as an HTML document conforming to this
specification, each document should start with the following prologue:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
]]></listing>
<NOTE>If the body of a <code>text/html</> message entity does not begin
with a document type declaration, an HTML user agent should infer the
above document type declaration.
</note>

HTML user agents are required to support the above document
type declaration and the following document type declarations:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0 Level 2//EN">
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0 Level 1//EN">
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0 Strict//EN">
]]></listing>

The <code/Strict/ public identifier refers to the HTML DTD with the
<code/HTML.Recommended/ entity defined as <code/INCLUDE/ rather than
<code/IGNORE/; that is, it refers to the more structurally rigid
definition of HTML. (see <hdref refid=feature-test>).

They are not required to support other document types, but
they may.  In particular, they may support other formal public
identifiers, or other document types altogether. They may support
an internal declaration subset with supplemental entity,
element, and other markup declarations, or they may not.

<h2>Document Element: HTML

The HTML document element consists of a head and a body, much
like a memo or a mail message. The head contains the
title and other optional elements. The body is a text flow
consisting of paragraphs, lists, and other elements.

<h2>Head: HEAD

<p>The head of an HTML document is an unordered collection of
information about the document. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Introduction to HTML</TITLE>
</HEAD>
...
]]></listing>

&head-elts;

<h2>Body: BODY

<p>The <tag/BODY/ element contains the text flow of the document,
including headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.

For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<BODY>
<h1>Important Stuff</h1>
<p>Explanation about important stuff...
</BODY>
]]></listing>

&headings;

&blocks;

&lists;

&phrase;

&doc-charset;

&hyperlink;

&forms;
