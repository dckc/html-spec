<h1>Document Structure

An HTML document is a hierarchy of elements.

<h2>Document Element: HTML

The HTML document element consists of a head and a body, much
like a memo or a mail message. The head contains the
title and other optional elements. The body is a text flow
consisting of paragraphs, lists, and other elements.

<h2>Head: HEAD

<p>The head of an HTML document is an unordered collection of
information about the document. For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Introduction to HTML</TITLE>
</HEAD>
...
]]></listing>

&head-elts;

<h2>Body: BODY

<p>The <tag/BODY/ element contains the text flow of the document,
including headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.

For example:

<listing><![CDATA[
<BODY>
<h1>Important Stuff</h1>
<p>Explanation about important stuff...
</BODY>
]]></listing>

&headings;

&blocks;

&lists;

&phrase;

&doc-charset;

&hyperlink;

&forms;
