<H1>Historical Note: XMP and LISTING</H1>The <A
NAME="z1" HREF="NonStandard.html#8">XMP and LISTING elements</A> used
historically to have non SGML conforming
specifications, in that the text
could contain any ISO Latin printable
characters, including the tag opener,
so long as it does not contain the
closing tag in full.<P>
This form is not supported by SGML
and so is not the specified HTML
interpretation.  Providers should
be warned that implementations may
vary on how they interpret end tags
apparently within these elements</BODY>
