<H1>HTML and SGML</H1>This section describes the relationship
between HTML and SGML, and guides
the newcomer through interpreation
of the <A
NAME=z1 HREF="DTDHeading.html">DTD</A>.  (This is not a full
tutorial on SGML, and in the event
of any apparent conflict, the SGML
standard is definitive.)<P>
The HyperText Markup Language is
defined in terms of the ISO Standard
Generalized Markup Language [<A
NAME=z0 HREF="References.html#z3"> SGML</A>
]. SGML is a system for defining
structured document types, and markup
languages to represent instances
of those document types.<P>
Every SGML document has three parts:
<UL>
<LI>An SGML declaration, which binds
SGML processing quantities and syntax
token names to specific values. For
example, the SGML declaration in
the HTML DTD specifies that the string
that opens a tag is 60;/ and the
maximum length of a name is 34 characters.
<LI>A prologue including one or more
document type declarations, which
specifiy the element types, element
relationships and attributes, and
references that can be represented
by markup. The HTML DTD specifies,
for example, that the HEAD element
contains at most one TITLE element.
<LI>An instance, which contains the data
and markup of the document.
</UL>We use the term HTML to mean both
the document type and the markup
language for representing instances
of that document type.<P>
All HTML documents share the same
SGML declaration an prologue. Hence
implementations of the WorldWide
Web generally only transmit and store
the instance part of an HTML document.
To construct an SGML document entity
for processing by an SGML parser,
it is necessary to prefix the text
from ``HTML DTD'' on page 10 to the
HTML instance.<P>
Conversely, to implement an HTML
parser, one need only implement those
parts of an SGML parser that are
needed to parse an instance after
parsing the HTML DTD.</BODY>
