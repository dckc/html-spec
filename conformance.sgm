<h2>Levels of Conformance

<emph>@@ this needs a LOT of work!</emph>

Version 2.0 of HTML introduces a distinction between levels of
conformance:

<tl>
<tli>Level 0: Indicates the minimum conformance level. When writing
Level 0 documents, authors can be confident that the rendering at
different sites will reflect their intent.

<tli>Level 1: Includes Level 0 features plus features such as
highlighting and images.

<tli>Level 2: Includes all Level 0 and Level 1 features, plus forms.

</tl>
